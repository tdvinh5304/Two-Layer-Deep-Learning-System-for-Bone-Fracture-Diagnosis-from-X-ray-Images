# Bone Fracture Diagnosis and RAG Chatbot System

This repository contains an **AI-powered medical imaging system** for **bone fracture diagnosis from X-ray images**, combined with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** that provides bone anatomy and fracture-related medical knowledge.

The project is designed as a **two-layer system**:

1. **Deep Learning models** for automated fracture detection by body part.
2. **RAG chatbot** backed by a medical knowledge base for explainability and user support.

## Deep Learning Models

* Trained on **X-ray images** for multiple body parts:

  * Elbow, Finger, Forearm, Hand, Humerus, Shoulder, Wrist
* Architectures used:

  * **ResNet**
  * **InceptionV3**
* Each model is optimized for **body-part–specific fracture detection**.

---

## RAG Chatbot (Bone Knowledge Assistant)

The chatbot uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to:

* Answer questions about **bone anatomy and fractures**
* Provide **medical explanations** to support AI predictions
* Retrieve information from trusted medical documents (e.g. BOA/BAPRAS standards)

**Tech stack:**

* ChromaDB (vector database)
* Embedding-based document retrieval
* LLM-powered response generation

---

## How to Run

### 1️. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️. Build medical knowledge base

```bash
python src/import_db.py
```

### 3. Run the application

```bash
python src/app.py
```
