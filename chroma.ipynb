There have subsequently been major \\nadvances in the logistics, the provision, and the monitoring of care for patients \\nsustaining injuries with open fractures in the UK. In 2012 major trauma centres \\nand networks were established across England, in 2016 the National Institute \\nfor Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidance for managing com-\\nplex fractures, and in 2017 based on this the Open Fracture BOAST (BOA \\nSTandards ) from the British Orthopaedic Association was updated.\\nIn the light of these changes a new edition of this book was needed. As an \\nexample of orthoplastic collaboration the opportunity was taken to expand on \\nthis work and involve a broader group in its production on behalf of BAPRAS \\nand the BOA. We have been able to draw on the expertise of many colleagues \\nwith great experience and in- depth k nowledge of managing these injuries. The \\ncontents have been updated to reflect the recent NICE Guidelines and latest lit-\\nerature. Paradigms in management have been generated through an evidence \\nbase and, when a clear choice between available alternatives for management \\nis absent, the contributors provide a balanced view by highlighting the relative \\nmerits and drawbacks of each. In addition to the evidence- bas ed recommenda-\\ntions, the authors have provided technical tips and descriptions of ‘how to do \\nit’ where relevant.\\nThe NICE Guidelines 2016 and the Open Fracture BOAST 2017 consolidated \\nthe orthoplastic approach to open fractures advocated in the first edition of \\nthis book. In each of those guidelines the range of injuries included was ex -\\ntended beyond the lower limb, hence this book now being titled Open Fracture \\nStandards to accommodate this. It remains the case that much of the evidence \\nand consequently the narrative of this book refers to the tibia. The book has \\nbeen expanded to include new topics of relevance to the patient with open frac-\\ntures. There are now chapters on how to set up a service to deal with open frac-\\ntures, the psychological aspects of trauma, and management of fractures in the \\nyoung and elderly populations. However, the core message and express intent is \\nto enable the orthoplastic management of an open fracture whenever required. \\nWe envisage that this new edition with the included NICE Guidelines and Open \\nThis is an open access publication.

The NICE Complex Fracture Guidelines 2016 defined an orthoplastic \\ncentre, which has the following key characteristics:\\n ◆ A\\xa0combined service of orthopaedic and plastic surgery consultants.\\n ◆ Sufficient combined operating lists with consultants from both specialties to \\nmeet the standards for timely management of open fractures.\\n ◆ Scheduled, combined review clinics for severe open fractures.\\n ◆ Specialist nursing teams able to care for both fractures and fla ps.\\nIn addition, an effective orthoplastic service will also:\\n ◆ Submit data on each patient to the Trauma Audit and Research Network \\n(TARN).\\n ◆ Hold regular clinical audit meetings with both orthopaedic and plastic sur-\\ngeons present.\\nFor the past 20\\xa0years the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and British \\nAssociation of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) have \\nworked together to produce professional guidelines for the management of se-\\nvere open tibial fractures, promoting a joint ‘orthoplastics’ approach to care, \\nand this has led to the development of clinical audit standards that have been \\nused both nationally and internationally to improve the care of trauma pa -\\ntients.

Patients with open fractures of long bones, hind foot, or midfoot should \\nbe taken directly or transferred to a specialist centre that can provide \\nOrthoplastic* care. Patients with hand, wrist, forefoot, or digit injuries \\nmay be managed locally following similar principles.\\n 2. Intravenous prophylactic antibiotics should be administered as soon as \\npossible, ideally within 1\\xa0hour of injury.\\n 3. There should be a readily accessible published network guideline for the \\nuse of antibiotics in open fractures.\\n 4. The examination of the injured limb should include assessment and \\ndocumentation of the vascular and neurological status. This should be \\nrepeated systematically, particularly after reduction manoeuvres or the \\napplication of splints. Management of suspected compartment syndrome \\nshould follow BOAST guidelines.\\n 5. The limb should be re- align ed and splinted.\\nThis is an open access publication.

Although much of the evidence described here is based upon open \\nfracture of the tibia, the principles described also apply to open fractures of other \\nlong bones, including those of the upper limb (excluding the hand and wrist), \\neven though complex soft tissue reconstruction is required less commonly.\\nNot all open fractures occur in the context of high- energ y trauma, but many \\ndo and a systematic approach to assess, identify, and treat the most serious in-\\njuries first is imperative. The management of the open fracture is considered \\nconcurrently with other patient co- morb idities and associated injuries. In the \\nUK, the Major Trauma Networks have guidance based upon the international \\nAdvanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)® system; this includes prehospital as -\\nsessment, transport of patients, rapid whole- bod y cross- sec tional imaging, and \\nmajor transfusion protocols (2, 3).\\nPrimary\\xa0survey\\nAfter scene safety, the CABCDE (Circulation (exsanguinating haemorrhage), \\nAirway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) principles should be fol-\\nlowed. Although angulated fractures may draw the prehospital clinician’s at -\\ntention, life- thre atening conditions should take priority (1– 3). Exsa nguinating \\nexternal haemorrhage should be controlled prior to the management of airway \\nor breathing.\\nAssessment of\\xa0the\\xa0limb\\nLimb assessment in the prehospital environment is dictated by the setting, \\nother injuries, and obvious flags such as patient signs and symptoms.

The paradigm of ‘look, feel, and move’ on limbs \\nshould identify important injuries at this stage (1), but this is omitted in the \\npresence of obvious fractures to avoid more pain. Wounds are of relevance and \\nraise the possibility of an open fracture. If there is doubt about an open fracture, \\nit is safer to proceed as though open until proven otherwise; a photograph of the \\nwound in the prehospital setting may aid decisions in treatment.\\nA key initial assessment is for vascular injury by the presence or absence of \\neach of the distal pulses. Vascular deficit mandates immediate realignment. \\nThe capillary refill time can be misleading and hard signs (palpable pulses, ex-\\npanding haematoma, continued bleeding) should be relied upon. Neurological \\nassessment of motor function should test for active movements and of sensa -\\ntion by response to touch.\\nManagement of\\xa0limb\\nAdequate analgesia is important in all patients suspected of a fracture; addition-\\nally, reduction of deformity and splintage reduce bleeding and pain. If the bone \\nends of an open fracture retract into the wound during splinting, this informa-\\ntion must be documented. A\\xa0traction device is used if the injury is above the \\nknee. All other long bone injuries should be splinted with a vacuum splint (1, \\n2). When an intervention is performed, e.g. application of a splint, the vascular \\nand neurological assessments should be repeated and documented.\\nIrrigation of open fractures at the prehospital stage is not recommended but \\ngross contamination should be removed. Clean saline- soa ked gauze held with \\nan occlusive layer should be applied to the wound. Information about potential \\ncontamination by agricultural, marine, or sewage matter needs to be relayed to \\nthe admitting team as this has direct implications for the urgency of surgical \\nwound excision.\\nAntibiotics are given as soon as possible and preferably within an hour of \\ninjury. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with open \\nfractures is supported by a Cochrane Systematic review (4), which reported an \\nabsolute risk reduction of 0.08 based on data from 913 participants in seven \\npublished studies (see the section on ‘ Antibiotics’ for choice of antibiotics). \\nTiming of administration of the antibiotics was found to be an independent \\nrisk factor in a retrospective study, with delay beyond 1\\xa0hour after injury asso-\\nciated with an increased risk of infection (odds ratio 3.78, CI 1.16–  12.31) (5). \\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends the \\nadministration of antibiotics within 1\\xa0hour of the injury but this should not \\ndelay transfer to hospital (4).\\nThis is an open access publication.

Another study \\nsuggested low deep surgical site infection rate with early wound excision (less \\nthan 8\\xa0hours) (7). A\\xa0further three studies suggested timing of wound excision \\nis not a predictor of deep surgical site infection (8– 10). In a la rge retrospective \\nstudy of patients with open tibial fractures, primary wound excision beyond the \\nfirst day of admission was associated with a significantly increased probability \\nof amputation (11).\\nNICE have recommended that all open fractures should be excised jointly \\nby consultant orthopaedic and plastic surgeons. A\\xa0series comparing open frac-\\ntures managed by a specialist centre versus those initially managed at local \\ncentres showed that the latter had increased complication rates and revision \\nsurgery (12).

After controlling for confounding variables and considering all grades \\nof fractures together, they found with each hour passing post-  injur y there \\nwas an increase in the odds ratio for infection of 1.033. When subdivided \\nby fracture severity, a delay in the first wound excision had a greater effect \\non higher- grade fractures. Open fractures of the tibia had an increased odds \\nratio for infection of 2.44 compared with non- tib ia sites and high- grade (IIIB \\nand IIIC) had higher rates of infection than low-  grade (II an d IIIA) injuries. \\nTherefore, high- grade frac tures of the tibia where excision is delayed are at the \\ngreatest risk of developing deep infection. The NICE Guidance Development \\nGroup recommended that highly contaminated fractures such as those ex -\\nposed to the aquatic environment or sustained in the agricultural environ -\\nment should be excised immediately in theatre. High-  grade op en fractures \\n(presumed grade IIIA or IIIB) should be excised within 12\\xa0hours and all other \\nopen fractures, excluding those of the hand, toes, and wrist, within 24\\xa0hours \\nof the injury.\\nThis is an open access publication.

A\\xa0systematic \\napproach to wound excision is recommended, working from the wound margin \\nto the centre and from the superficial structures to the deep layers of the wound. \\nThe wound extensions must allow inspection of the deep posterior muscle com-\\npartment in severe injuries to identify devitalised muscle, foreign material, and \\nbone fragments driven into the tissues at the time of injury.

These findings \\nundermine current wound excision practices and suggest that surgeons may \\nexcise potentially viable muscle. Equally, retained dead muscle may lead to deep \\ninfection, emphasising the importance of consultant surgeons experienced in \\ntrauma management working together to achieve optimal outcomes.\\nCortical bone has a relatively poor blood supply and assessment of viability is \\ndifficult. Small bone fragments with tenuous soft tissue attachments, which dis-\\nlodge or separate easily during a steady pull (the ‘tug test’), should be removed \\nowing to their poor blood supply.

If there is doubt regarding the viability of bone ends or fragments, \\nthey should probably be removed.

The development of an \\nall- encompassing classification system for open fractures has proven difficult \\ndue to the difficulties of accurately characterising the multiple tissues involved \\nin the injury. Although several classification systems for open fractures have \\nbeen proposed, the Gustilo– Ander son classification first described in 1976 for \\nopen tibial fractures is the most widely used (12). After reviewing their initial \\nclassification of the most severe open injuries, Gustilo et\\xa0al. subsequently modi-\\nfied the classification system into its current form in 1984 and the grading has \\nsince been applied to open fractures in all regions of the body (13, 14).\\nType I\\xa0fractures are low- energ y injuries with a wound of less than 1\\xa0cm and \\nno muscle damage or contamination.

In \\nview of the limitations of the Gustilo– Ander son classification, assessment of all \\nopen fractures should include the mechanism of injury, the appearance of the \\nsoft tissue envelope and its condition in the operating room, the level of likely \\nbacterial contamination, and the specific characteristics of the fracture (14). \\nHence the definitive assessment of an open fracture is best accomplished after \\nformal surgical exploration and wound excision rather than in the emergency \\ndepartment (17).\\nWound\\xa0closure\\nTraditionally, delayed wound closure was the accepted approach to prevent deep \\ninfection in open fractures, particularly infection caused by Clostridia species \\nor other anaerobic organisms (18). Primary wound closure in selected cases has \\nthe potential advantage of protection against hospital-  acquire d (nosocomial) \\ninfections. In addition, immediate wound closure may reduce the number of \\nsurgeries required and allow earlier mobilisation and discharge from hospital \\n(19). A\\xa0 number of studies have suggested that primary closure in appropri -\\nately selected subjects results in acceptable patient outcomes with low rates of \\ninfection (19, 20). The difficulty lies in defining which wounds are amenable \\nto early closure. Immediate wound closure should only be performed after a \\njoint decision by experienced orthopaedic and plastic consultants working at a \\nhigh- volume trauma centre, and patients must be closely monitored to assess \\nfor surgical site infection.\\nThis is an open access publication.

It occurs when the skin \\nsurface is subjected to forces, including torsion, crush, avulsion, or a combin-\\nation of these. The soft tissues are sheared along single or multiple tissue planes, \\ndepending on the severity of the injury. In uniplanar injuries, degloving occurs \\nbetween the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. By contrast, in multiplanar in -\\njuries tissues are disrupted between and within muscle groups and between \\nmuscle and bone. Therefore, multiplanar degloving injuries represent a much \\nmore severe group. Both trans-  mus cular and intermuscular perforating ves -\\nsels that normally perfuse the skin are avulsed during the degloving process, \\nresulting in necrosis of the overlying skin. Necrosis of the degloved tissues \\nmay evolve over time and, whilst the underlying mechanisms remain largely \\nunknown, venous congestion and inflammatory cell infiltrate may contribute \\nand subjacent haematoma leads to production of proinflammatory cytokines \\nand free radicals (1).

Intra-   and \\nsubdermal thrombosis manifests as ‘fixed staining’ . This refers to the state of the \\nskin on clinical inspection where there is a spectrum of discolouration of the \\nskin. The colour can vary from red to blue but fails to blanch on digital pres -\\nsure. Intravenous fluorescein may delineate non- via ble tissues more accurately \\n(4)\\xa0but requires specialised equipment, carries a small risk of anaphylaxis, and \\nhas poor specificity.\\nIn the clinical setting, the most useful classification system describes four \\npatterns of degloving (3):\\n 1. localised degloving;\\n 2. non- circumferential, single plane degloving;\\n 3. single plane, circumferential degloving;\\n 4. circumferential and multiplanar degloving.\\nOver bony prominences, such as malleoli and condyles, pattern 1 can be asso-\\nciated with soft tissue loss because the mechanism of injury that usually causes \\ndegloving in these areas can result in tissue abrasion and avulsion. Whilst pat-\\nterns 2, 3, and 4 can present as closed injuries, in practice, pattern 4 usually pre-\\nsents as an open wound. Circumferentially degloved skin is usually not viable \\nas it will have been stripped of the perforators upon which it survives. Multiple \\npatterns may co- exist in s ome patients and multiplanar injuries can occur in the \\nabsence of circumferential degloving. Patients with a wide zone of multiplanar \\ndegloving associated with a segmental tibial fracture may be best served by a \\nprimary amputation. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate to use \\nfree tissue transfer to achieve soft tissue coverage of the residual limb to enable \\na trans- tibial rather than through- kne e amputation or to consider using spare \\nparts from the distal part of the limb (5).\\nManagement\\nDegloving injuries require definitive reconstructive surgery, which comprises \\nexcision of devitalised tissue and application of meshed split thickness skin \\ngraft, with flap coverage for exposed bone and fractures.

The area is then excised systematically as per the approach used for \\nwound excision (see Chapter\\xa03). The soft tissues are assessed from superficial to \\ndeep in turn. On occasions when the soft tissue damage is difficult to assess, a \\nsecond look should be undertaken 24– 48\\xa0ho urs later when the devitalised tis-\\nsues will have declared themselves. However, a general principle in open frac-\\nture management is that open fractures should be covered as soon as possible, \\nand certainly within 72\\xa0hours. Therefore, repeated wound excisions are best \\navoided if possible (6).\\nAt the end of soft tissue wound excision, conditions should be akin to those \\nencountered during elective surgical wounds and meshed split thickness skin \\ngraft can be applied if appropriate. Skin grafting should not be performed if \\nthere is an underlying exposed fracture, which should instead be covered with \\na flap. Occasionally, the degloved skin can be used as a source of skin graft if it \\nhas not been traumatised directly. Some authors have reported the use of me-\\nshed split thickness autograft supplemented with overlying allograft or with an \\nunderlying dermal substitute such as Integra\\n® (7). Full thickness skin grafting \\nhas also been described (8, 9). However, there is limited evidence to support \\nthese techniques and outcomes are likely unreliable.\\nWe recommend the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to se-\\ncure the skin grafts (10). This offers the benefits of securing the graft to the \\nrecipient wound bed, which is often irregular, thus reducing the risk of fluid \\ncollections under the graft and maximising graft take (11, 12). A\\xa0comparative \\nstudy has shown that negative pressure treatment led to reduced requirement \\nfor repeated skin grafts and improved overall graft survival (12). A\\xa0subsequent \\nclinical trial found that NPWT also improved the qualitative appearance of split \\nthickness skin grafts compared with standard dressings (13).\\nClosed degloving can present as post-  traum atic subcutaneous fluid collec -\\ntions and diagnosis may be delayed several days to months following injury. \\nDelayed diagnosis and treatment often results in full thickness necrosis due to \\ncompromised vascular supply of the avulsed skin flap. A\\xa0specific type of closed \\ndegloving injury, where the subdermal fat is sheared from its underlying fascia \\nand is associated with an effusion containing haematoma, lymphatic fluid, and \\nnecrotic fat, is known as the Morel–  Lava llée lesion (14). These tend to occur \\nin polytrauma patients and are associated with a high rate of infection, espe -\\ncially if there is an underlying fracture (15). Early diagnosis (by MRI) and treat-\\nment of closed degloving injuries are important to prevent infection, extensive \\nskin necrosis, and chronic recurrence (16). Management options include as-\\npiration and insertion of vacuum drains, or wound excision with or without \\nsclerosing agents, followed by external compression.

NPWT works by a combination of macromechanical \\ndeformation, micromechanical deformation (stimulating mesenchymal \\nmechanoreceptor- medi ated proliferation and differentiation), permissive \\nhypoxia- mediated angiogenesis (as a consequence of positive pressure to the \\nwound bed), and the removal of oedema (8). At a molecular level NPWT sup-\\npresses the expression of pro- inflamm atory cytokines TNF and IL- 1β and p ro-\\nmotes expression of anti-  inflamm atory cytokines such as IL-  10 and g rowth \\nfactors VEGF and TGF- β (9).\\nTherapy variables include the magnitude of negative pressure, the periodicity \\nof application of negative pressure (continuous or intermittent), the material \\nand deformational properties of the wound filler, and the use of an additional \\ninterface layer between the wound filler and wound bed, which may reduce \\ngranulation tissue ingrowth into the filler, confer antibacterial properties, and \\ninfluence the deformational characteristics of the wound filler and the trans -\\nmission of pressure to the wound bed (10). Whilst early studies reported en -\\nhanced local blood flow with the use of an intermittent NPWT regimen (the \\n5\\xa0minutes on; 2\\xa0minutes off regime), the conclusions drawn from these data \\nhave been contested (5). Furthermore, whilst there is some evidence to suggest \\nthat intermittent application of NPWT may enhance wound healing in experi-\\nmental models, this has not yet translated into a reliable therapeutic strategy \\n(11,12). The available evidence for the influence of magnitude of negative pres-\\nsure would suggest that\\xa0– 80\\xa0mmHg s hould be used as a default (13) as higher \\npressures are unlikely to confer additional clinical advantage and may even be \\ndetrimental to local tissue perfusion (14). The most commonly utilised wound \\nfiller is polyurethane (PU) foam. Under topical negative pressure the collaps -\\nible porous structure results in macromechanical wound deformation that \\nmay not be desirable in some areas, for example, a flexure crease over a joint. \\nAdditionally the porosity encourages granulation tissue ingrowth that leads \\nto painful dressing changes as friable, bleeding tissue within the porous struc-\\nture is pulled from the wound as the dressing is changed. The limited ability of \\nPU foam to conform to complex wound geometry has led to the use of gauze, \\nsuch as polyhexanide- impr egnated Kerlix™ as an alternative filler (15) without \\ndemonstrable differences in macro-  and micr omechanical wound deformation \\nand pressure transduction (16, 17). Whilst the use of a single layer of inter -\\nface material probably makes little difference to the application of pressure to \\nthe wound bed, non- adher ent interface materials may be used to protect vital \\nstructures such as vessels and nerves.\\nThis is an open access publication.

Experimentally, acute, chronic, and pre-  cont aminated wounds \\nhave all been investigated to answer this question, but intermittent surgical \\nwound excision and the simultaneous use of systemic antibiotics have compli-\\ncated data analysis and interpretation. Early studies hypothesised that NPWT \\nsuppressed bacterial growth, although more recent data suggest that this is an \\noversimplification. A\\xa0recent systematic review aimed at establishing whether \\nNPWT acts in part by improving bacterial clearance of the wound included 20 \\nstudies of which 10 were experimental studies, 4 were randomised controlled \\ntrials, and 6 clinical series.\\nFour additional studies (2 experimental studies and 2 clinical series) evalu -\\nated NPWT when used with periodic installation of antibacterial solutions. The \\nauthors concluded that the influence of NPWT on bacterial growth kinetics is \\nprobably species- spe cific. NPWT may selectively suppress the replication of \\nGram negative rods such as Pseudomonas spp. thereby depopulating the niche \\nthat is then filled by Gram positive cocci (18). The solution to this problem \\nmay lie in the use of antibacterial wound fillers and interface materials such as \\nsilver- impregnated foam and gauze. Whilst one study reported that the use of \\na silver- impregnated interface markedly suppressed growth of Staphylococcus \\naureus (19), corroborative data are, as yet, lacking.\\nNPWT works as a closed system. Leaks in the transparent membrane re -\\nsult in the continuous inflow of air from the external environment, risking \\ncontamination and wound desiccation. The NPWT pump sounds an alarm \\nwhen the seal is breached. Maintenance of the seal can be challenging where \\nthe wound geometry is complex or where adjacent orifices preclude a reliable \\nseal. Wounds under continuous (or intermittent) suction risk large losses of \\nfluid, including blood. Therefore, it is important to examine the contents of \\nthe reservoir and document volumes collected at regular intervals and to take \\nthe patient back to the operating theatre should any concerns be raised over \\nongoing losses.\\nWhat is the\\xa0evidence for\\xa0NPWT in\\xa0open fractures?\\nSeveral series have evaluated the use of NPWT in the immediate management \\nof open fractures, i.e. the use of NPWT after the first surgical wound excision \\nin those wounds that cannot be closed by direct suturing of the wound edges. \\nThe outcomes included infection, the subsequent reconstructive require-\\nment of the wound, and the permissible delay between injury and definitive \\nreconstruction.\\nThis is an open access publication.

Thus, antibiotic beads should \\nnot be used in combination with NPWT.\\nConclusion\\nWhilst NICE previously recommended that NPWT be considered as a tem -\\nporary dressing for managing open fractures following wound excision, a \\nmore recent large randomised clinical trial has shown that the NPWT pro-\\nvides no benefit over standard dressings provided. This finding was supported \\nby the latest Cochrane review of negative pressure wound therapy for open \\ntraumatic wounds (42). These data would suggest that provided the other \\nprincipal recommendations in these Standards are followed, including timely \\nwound excision performed jointly by consultant plastic and orthopaedic sur -\\ngeons and prompt definitive wound coverage within 72\\xa0hours of the injury, \\nthe precise dressing used in the intervening period is relatively unimportant. \\nCurrent evidence suggests that if definitive soft tissue closure of the wound is \\ndelayed beyond 3\\xa0days the deep infection rate rises steeply and NPWT should \\nnot be used to delay definitive closure. This calls into question the strategy of \\nusing NPWT for prolonged periods to reduce the reconstructive requirements \\nof the wound. There is low-  leve l evidence to suggest that silver-  impr egnated \\ndressings or antibiotic-  impr egnated beads may reduce deep soft tissue and \\nbone infections, respectively, following high-  energ y open fractures. There is \\na need for further randomised trials of alternative types of wound dressings \\nand wound management strategies in open fractures. The role of NPWT in \\nmanaging closed incisions at high risk of wound complications, such as those \\nassociated with open fractures, has recently been assessed in a large random -\\nised clinical trial that had shown that the NPWT provides no benefit over \\nstandard dressings (42).\\nReferences\\n 1.

Thus, plastic surgeons need to be involved \\nwith their orthopaedic colleagues over configurations of external fixators such \\nthat the proposed reconstruction of soft tissue defects is unimpeded by the \\ndevice. Traction or long leg plaster slabs are not recommended after primary \\ndebridement.\\nVarious external fixator systems are available for this purpose and are cap -\\nable of being applied rapidly and easily. There are several fundamental proper-\\nties that contribute to stable provisional external fixation including component \\nchoice, location of pins and overall fixator assembly.\\nChoosing appropriate fixator\\xa0components\\nThe generic components are the half- pin (or s crew), clamp and rod. Half- pins \\nand rods should be of a large diameter (2). In adults, 5 or 6\\xa0mm half- pins s hould \\nbe selected over the smaller 4\\xa0mm, whereas in children 4\\xa0mm pins are sufficient. \\nRods should be greater than 10\\xa0mm in diameter for adults and rods less than \\n10\\xa0mm, typically 8– 9\\xa0mm, ca n be used in children. The bending stiffness of each \\nof these cylindrical components increases exponentially with the fourth power \\nof the radius; by selecting a large diameter half-  pin an d rod the surgeon can \\nincrease the stiffness of the assembled external fixator without need for duplica-\\ntion of components. This simplifies the configuration and facilitates soft tissue \\nreconstruction by leaving a greater space free for unhindered access.\\nSafe\\xa0corridors\\nIt was taught previously that the anteromedial surface of the tibia is the safest \\narea to insert a half-  pin. Unf ortunately, whilst access to drill and insert a pin \\nperpendicular to the subcutaneous surface of the tibia is uncomplicated, the \\nexit point of the drill or half- pin c an impinge on either the deep peroneal nerve \\nor anterior tibial artery as both these important structures are situated on the \\ninterosseous membrane adjacent to the lateral wall in the proximal three-  \\nquarters of the tibia (Figure 6.1). Consequently, we recommend that the pins \\nare inserted 1\\xa0cm medial to the crest of the tibia in the sagittal plane (3). Drilling \\ncan start perpendicular to the surface of the bone to prevent drill slip but, once \\nthe bone surface is entered, the drill should then be brought to a vertical align-\\nment to penetrate the tibia in the sagittal plane. A\\xa0half-  pin ins erted in the sa -\\ngittal plane has the following advantages:\\n 1. It controls displacing forces in the sagittal plane better. For the supine pa -\\ntient, lifting the leg or moving the patient will create displacing forces in this \\nplane from the action of gravity (4).\\nThis is an open access publication.

Four pins with two in each segment will suffice \\nprovided the pins are placed near to and far from the fracture within each seg-\\nment (the near– far pr inciple). This spread of pins in each segment exerts an \\nadvantageous grip but the caveat is to avoid placing pins within exposed tibia or \\nwithin the zone of injury.\\nA simple way to achieve this four pin-  single b ar assembly is to insert the \\nmost proximal and most distal pins first and connect the single bar between \\nthem. Traction is applied across the fracture to achieve approximate alignment \\nand the clamps then tightened. The additional two pins closer to the fracture \\nare then inserted through additional clamps attached to the same rod; some \\nimprovement to the quality of reduction is possible when these pins are intro-\\nduced. Such a construct achieves the ‘near– far’ h alf- pin pl acement with regard \\nto the fracture site and produces good control of proximal and distal segments \\nof the fracture (Figure 6.4A– D).\\nWhen the fracture is situated in the distal third of the tibia, there may be room \\nfor a single pin in the distal segment or none at all, e.g. in open fractures of the \\ntibial plafond. In these circumstances, crossing the ankle joint provides add -\\nitional stability as the short distal tibial portion together with the foot constitute \\nthe ‘distal segment’ . Pin placement in the foot and ankle requires some thought; \\nthe calcaneum, first metatarsal, neck of talus, and cuboid can be used. Two sep-\\narate pins in the foot provide far better control than a single transcalcaneal pin. \\nAgain, control of sagittal plane forces is more important as ankle movement oc-\\ncurs in this plane, as does the displacing effect of gravity during patient move-\\nment or transfer. A\\xa0single half- pin in th e calcaneum used with a talar neck or base \\nof metatarsal pin is a good combination.

If wound closure requires a local or \\nfree flap and the fracture has little bone loss or contamination, internal fixation \\ncarries low rates of infection as long as definitive soft tissue closure using well- \\nvascularised tissue is achieved at the same time. Such situations occur when \\nboth orthopaedic and plastic surgeons decide that definitive skeletal stabilisa -\\ntion and cover can be accomplished then and there and safely. In that scenario, \\nthe entire operative procedure is carried out as a formal second intervention; \\nthis would involve new instruments, a re-  prep a nd re- drape o f the limb, and \\nthe surgical team changing into fresh attire. Whilst direct evidence to support \\nthis two- procedure single- sta ge event is absent, open injuries that are excised \\n(debrided) and lavaged of gross or even microscopic contaminants will render \\nall instruments and drapes used unsterile without exception.\\nIn contrast, if provisional external fixation is used and wound closure delayed, \\nconversion to internal fixation should proceed cautiously. The risks associated \\nwith conversion from provisional spanning external fixation to internal fixation \\nhave not been quantified. Recommendations that intervals of 4–  28\\xa0 da ys are \\n‘safe’ are quoted but intramedullary canal contamination from pin sites is an \\nearly phenomenon and infection from one pin site tracking along the canal to \\nreach the remainder of the cavity does occur (20–  23). If con version from ex-\\nternal to internal fixation is planned, we recommended that this be achieved \\nwithin 72\\xa0hours of the primary wound excision (debridement) (this implies \\nthat it is performed usually at the second-  look p rocedure) and that definitive \\nsoft tissue cover is achieved at the same time. If this window of opportunity for \\nconversion is missed, consideration should be given to definitive management \\nwith modern multiplanar or circular external fixators.\\nDegree and location of\\xa0soft tissue and bone\\xa0loss\\nCurrent techniques for dealing with bone loss include the creation of new \\nbone by distraction osteogenesis (the Ilizarov method) or autogenous bone \\ngrafting following use of a cement spacer in the defect (the Masquelet \\nmethod) (24–  26).

In both, there is a \\nresulting defect that becomes filled with haematoma. This haematoma- fille d space \\ncan be prevented through the use of negative pressure wound dressings, antibiotic- \\nimpregnated cement spacers and, in some instances, performing an acute short-\\nening of the limb with the intention of restoring length at a later stage. Acute \\nshortening, if used for dead space management, may influence the choice of sta-\\nbilisation device as it is more common for a circular or rail- type fixa tor to be used \\nin this scenario as it then can be utilised for the subsequent limb lengthening (27).\\nDead space is often thought of as a cavity but any structure unable to provide \\nsome resistance to bacterial proliferation within or on itself— non- via ble tissue, \\nhaematoma, internal fixation devices— beh aves as dead space. For these reasons, \\nmeticulous wound excision (debridement), pervention of cavities, avoidance of \\ninternal fixation in highly contaminated injuries, and early definitive soft tissue \\ncover remain guiding principles for treating open fractures of the tibia.\\nConclusion\\nStable spanning external fixation is applied at the time of primary wound exci-\\nsion (debridement) if definitive fracture fixation is not performed. The choice \\nof components and the fixator configuration should resist displacing forces at \\nthe fracture site during patient transfer or with patient movement.

Provided comprehensive wound excision \\nhas been achieved, early definitive soft tissue coverage of open fractures is asso-\\nciated with reduced free flap failure and deep infection rates. Moreover, delay \\nleads to tissue oedema, peri-  vasc ular fibrosis, and an increased risk of venous \\nthrombosis, making the surgery more challenging technically.\\nA number of studies have investigated the effect of timing of soft tissue \\ncoverage. Whilst the definition of early and delayed wound closure varied be-\\ntween studies, the literature suggests that the best outcomes are achieved when \\nthe wounds are covered at the earliest opportunity.\\nVarious historic studies found that lengthy delays were associated with dra-\\nmatically poorer outcomes. A\\xa0retrospective series of over 500 cases demon -\\nstrated that free tissue transfer performed within 3\\xa0days, rather than 3\\xa0days to \\n3\\xa0months of injury, was associated with improved flap survival (0.75 vs 12%) \\nand reduced infection rates (1.5 vs 17.5%) (7). A\\xa0review of muscle flaps in grade \\nIIIB open tibial fractures found that patients with flap cover within 10\\xa0days \\nspent less time in hospital and had a deep infection rate of 18% compared with \\n69% in the delayed groups combined (9).\\nA group reviewing their outcome of 83 flap reconstructions in 64 patients \\nfound that the rate of deep infection associated with metal implants was signifi-\\ncantly lower in the early coverage group (<5\\xa0days) compared with the delayed \\ngroup, as were the rates of free flap failure and local flap partial necrosis (10). \\nAnother study of 105 patients who underwent free muscle flap reconstruction \\nfor open tibial fractures found that flaps performed between 1 and 7\\xa0days post- \\ninjury were associated with a lower overall complication rate of 31% compared \\nwith 39% in the >42\\xa0days group and 47% in the 8– 42\\xa0da ys group, whilst the time \\nto fracture union was 2.4 compared with 6.5 versus 6.2\\xa0months, respectively \\n(11). Early coverage with fasciocutaneous flaps has also been found to be bene-\\nficial. In a study of 38 patients with Gustilo– Ander son IIIB fractures in whom \\nfasciocutaneous flaps was the predominant reconstructive option, the infection \\nrate was found to be significantly lower in patients who had coverage within \\n7\\xa0days of injury (12.5%) compared with coverage at 7 or more days (53%); fur-\\nthermore, there was no evidence of a relationship between flap type and infec-\\ntion rate (12) Similar improved outcomes for patients undergoing definitive \\nsoft tissue reconstruction within 1\\xa0week have been reported by other groups \\n(13– 17).\\nFurther studies that attempted to assess the risk of delay suggest that wounds \\nshould be covered at the earliest opportunity.

A\\xa0retrospective study of 137 type III fractures also used multi-\\nvariate analysis and found that a delay of more than 5\\xa0days to wound coverage \\nwas an independent predictor of infection, with an odds ratio of 7.39 (19).\\nThe effect of even shorter delays was reported in a review of 105 consecutive \\nfree flap reconstructions for severe open lower limb trauma in 103 patients (20). \\nThe outcomes of patients reconstructed within 3\\xa0days of injury were compared \\nwith those beyond 7\\xa0days.

A\\xa0retrospective review of patients with grade IIIB or IIIC frac-\\ntures compared the effect of timing of reconstruction on deep infection rates \\n(22). In the first group, primary closure was achieved in a single ‘fix and flap’ \\nprocedure, comprising wound excision and skeletal stabilisation with a muscle \\nflap. The second and third groups underwent immediate wound excision and \\ninternal fixation but soft tissue cover was achieved between 48 and 72\\xa0hours, \\nand over 72\\xa0hours, respectively. The times to fracture union (28.8, 35.3, and 43.1 \\nweeks, respectively) were shorter in the ‘fix and flap’ group. Another group re-\\nviewed grade III fractures in 73 consecutive patients and compared those who \\nunderwent definitive fixation and immediate coverage against patients who had \\nstaged operations. The deep infection rate in the immediate group was only \\n4.2% compared with 34.6% in the staged group (23). Similarly, a retrospective \\nstudy of 89 Gustilo– Ander son IIIB fractures found that delayed soft tissue re-\\nconstruction was associated with osteomyelitis in 60% and flap failure in 23% \\ncompared with 4% for both in the immediate group (24).

Therefore, soft tissue reconstruction should be \\nperformed at the earliest safe opportunity to maximise the chances of long-  \\nterm success. The current NICE guidance (8), based on the available evidence, \\nrecommends that if definitive reconstruction is not performed at the time of \\nwound excision, it should be achieved within 72\\xa0hours of injury unless patient \\nfactors dictate otherwise.

The same inci -\\nsion will have been used to provide access for wound excision of the open frac-\\nture. This minimises the risk of damaging the perforating vessels that supply the \\noverlying skin whilst providing good access to the posterior tibial vessels. The \\nmedial incision is placed 1.5\\xa0cm posterior to the medial subcutaneous border of \\nthe tibia and lies anterior to the posterior tibial artery. Placement of the incision \\ntoo anteriorly risks exposure of the tibia in the tense, swollen limb. Conversely, \\nif the incision is too posterior, it will lie behind the fasciocutaneous perforators \\nand hence preclude the use of flaps based on them. Therefore, accurate place -\\nment is essential and we recommend marking the anatomical landmarks before \\nmaking the incisions.\\nLocal\\xa0flaps\\nIn general, local flaps are best suited for defects with a limited zone of injury \\nfrom low- energy trauma. The flap chosen should lie outside the zone of injury \\nto minimise complications such as partial or complete necrosis. A\\xa0common \\ncause of failure is raising fasciocutaneous flaps in areas where the skin has been \\ndegloved. Care must also be taken to ensure the fracture is covered and the en-\\ntire flap survives. Partial or tip necrosis is equivalent to complete flap failure as \\nthis would mean conversion back to an open fracture with the associated risks \\nof poor outcomes. Therefore, local flaps should be reserved for relatively low-  \\nenergy injuries where the zone of injury is limited. For higher energy injuries \\nand those with degloving free tissue transfer is necessary.\\nLocal fasciocutaneous\\xa0flaps\\nAn understanding of the topography of lower limb angiosomes together with \\naccurate mapping of perforating vessels has enabled the reliable use of local \\nfasciocutaneous flaps (2, 3)\\xa0(Figure 8.1).

However, in \\naddition to the proximal pedicle, the muscle relies on multiple segmental per-\\nforators, some of which require division for mobilisation. This precarious blood \\nsupply together with its close proximity to the posterior surface of the tibia and \\ninclusion in the zone of injury mean that it is an unreliable option for the recon-\\nstruction of open fractures (16).\\nA tibialis anterior muscle turnover flap can cover long narrow defects over \\nthe tibial crest but only for defects up to 1\\xa0cm wide (17).\\nFree\\xa0flaps\\nFree tissue transfer has revolutionised the management of open fractures. Free \\nflaps are preferred to local flap reconstruction for patients with multiple co-  \\nmorbidities such as diabetes, venous insufficiency, and peripheral arterial dis-\\nease. This subgroup of patients is at high risk of local flap failure and is often \\nerroneously considered to be unsuitable for free flaps. Careful optimisation of \\nthe patient and techniques can result in free flap success rates in open frac -\\nture of over 90% and similar to those for elective reconstructive surgery (18). \\nMicrosurgical free tissue transfer also provides a wide choice for reconstruction \\nof the defect. Flap selection depends on the size and location of the defect, lo-\\ncation of the recipient vessels (which are ideally outside the zone of injury), as \\nwell as the biological contribution of the constituent tissues.\\nFasciocutaneous versus muscle\\xa0flaps\\nEvery flap option is associated with its own advantages and disadvantages. \\nMuscle flaps easily conform to complex defects. Although initially bulky, the \\noedema can be controlled with a pressure garment once the overlying skin graft \\nis stable and any external fixator has been removed, and the denervated muscle \\nsoon atrophies and does not require thinning. A\\xa0disadvantage of muscle flaps \\nis that the overlying skin graft may be susceptible to minor trauma especially \\naround the foot and ankle, and the flap can be difficult to raise and re-  inset if \\nfurther open surgery at the fracture site is required.

Few of \\nthese studies have compared muscle flaps with fasciocutaneous flaps specific-\\nally and those that did were limited by a lack of statistical power and case het-\\nerogeneity. A\\xa0retrospective review of muscle and fascial flaps, both local and \\nfree, in lower extremity trauma found that complications were related to the \\nseverity of injury rather than the type of soft tissue coverage (19). Another study \\ncomparing muscle and fasciocutaneous flaps found that donor site morbidity \\nwas similar in both groups at around 4% (20). Comparison of free muscle and \\nfasciocutaneous flaps for lower extremity reconstruction found no difference \\nin major or minor complication rates (21), although patients who underwent \\nfasciocutaneous flap reconstruction were more likely to require revision sur -\\ngery to improve cosmesis. A\\xa0retrospective review of patients with open tibial \\nfractures treated with either free muscle or fasciocutaneous flaps showed that \\nequivalent numbers went on to achieve bony union and could walk unaided by \\n2\\xa0years and there was no difference in the rates of complete flap survival and \\nchronic osteomyelitis (22). The authors found that muscle conformed better to \\ncomplex defects but fasciocutaneous flaps better tolerated secondary surgical \\nprocedures. Another recent retrospective review found similar rates of limb sal-\\nvage and functional recovery when comparing muscle versus fasciocutaneous \\nfree flaps in acute traumatic injuries as well as chronic traumatic sequelae, \\nwith overall rates of flap loss and limb amputation of 8% and 6%, respectively \\n(23). In patients with grade IIIB injuries and/  or expos ed defect hardware, \\nfasciocutaneous flaps were more likely to require bone grafting for non- union \\ncompared with muscle flaps.

In a retrospective \\nreview of 68 patients with open tibial fractures requiring free tissue transfer, \\n18 patients had 22 vascular injuries (4 patients had injuries to 2 vessels) that \\nwere diagnosed using pre- opera tive computed tomography (CT) angiography \\n(38). In another series of severe open tibial injuries (37), 80.6% of 191 patients \\nunderwent vascular imaging. A\\xa0total of 57.1% had abnormal findings on im -\\naging compared with 11% on initial evaluation and there was a false positive \\nrate of 7.8%. In a randomised controlled trial in 157 patients with isolated open \\ntibial fractures and initially adequate circulation (39), the authors compared \\nthe outcomes of patients who underwent conventional wound excision and pri-\\nmary skeletal stabilisation with those who had routine exploration and repair of \\nthe major vessels and nerves. In the second group, 28.2% of patients were found \\nto have occult major vascular injuries, and outcomes at both intermediate and \\nlong- term follow- up wer e superior. These studies suggest that preoperative vas-\\ncular imaging can assist in preoperative planning. However, imaging of the vas-\\nculature should not delay operative intervention particularly when there is the \\nlimb is devascularised (see Chapter\\xa010). In the UK, many emergency units now \\noffer full body CT scans for trauma patients, hence CT angiogram should not \\ncause excessive delays and is recommended.\\nThis is an open access publication.

At an incidence of 7.2%, venous insufficiency was the com-\\nmonest cause of re- explora tion in free tissue transfers to the lower extremity, \\nand anastomoses to the superficial venous system group were associated with a \\nhigher rate of venous insufficiency and partial flap loss compared with the deep \\nvenous system group (40). The number of venous anastomoses that should be \\nperformed remains controversial. In elective free tissue transfer, the use of two \\nvenous anastomoses has been found to result in a significant reduction in the \\nrate of venous congestion without significantly impacting on either compli -\\ncation rate or operative time (41). Two retrospective reviews of over 300 free \\nflaps each for lower limb reconstruction found that anastomosis of one rather \\nthan two veins did not significantly reduce the rate of surgical complications \\nincluding total flap loss (40, 42). However, a recent retrospective study of 361 \\nfree flaps for Gustilo– Ander son grade IIIB and IIIC injuries (43) found that two \\nvenous anastomoses demonstrated a four- fold decrease in complication rates \\ncompared with a single venous anastomosis. Furthermore, venous size mis -\\nmatch of over 1\\xa0mm (when anastomosing large to small) was an independent \\npredictive factor for total flap failure.\\nMany patients suffer from postoperative oedema of the lower limb and the \\nflap. Various dangling protocols and compression stockings have been ad -\\nvocated to aid lymphatic and venous drainage. A\\xa0recent systematic review of \\ndangling regimes after free flap surgery to the lower limb (44) found that a 3-  \\nday flap training regime is sufficient for physiological training and that it may \\nbe appropriate to start dangling as early as postoperative day 3.\\xa0However, robust \\nevidence for dangling and compression is currently lacking (45, 46).\\nConclusion\\nDefinitive soft tissue coverage for open fractures should be achieved within \\n72\\xa0hours of the injury if it cannot be performed at the time of wound excision \\n(47). If internal fixation is used, definitive coverage should be achieved at the \\nsame time (47). An understanding of the topography of angiosomes of the leg \\npermits raising of local fasciocutaneous flaps reliably; these should be reserved \\nfor low- energy injuries where the flap donor site has not been degloved and, in \\nthe case of distally based flaps, direct visual inspection of the supplying perfor-\\nator confirms suitability. High- energ y fractures with a wide zone of injury suit-\\nable for reconstruction are best covered with free flaps, with the posterior tibial \\nvessels as the preferred recipient vessels for defects over the leg.\\nThis is an open access publication.

Safe and effective management requires expertise of both plastic and ortho-\\npaedic specialists in reconstruction.

The options for reconstruction will depend on the shape and size of the de-\\nfect, the location within the bone, the condition of the local soft tissue, and \\nthe patient’s general physical and mental health.\\n 4. Bone defects can be reconstructed through autogenous bone grafts (with \\nor without augmentation), vascularised free transfer of bone (usually the \\nfibula), or by distraction osteogenesis (according to the methods described \\nby Ilizarov).\\nIntroduction\\nThis chapter deals with the management of bone loss in open fractures with \\nparticular reference to the tibia. This is a challenging problem and requires \\ninput and expertise from orthopaedic and plastic surgery specialists in limb \\nreconstruction. The different sizes, shapes, and location of the defect will have \\ndiverse implications and management must be individualised.\\nAetiology of\\xa0bone\\xa0loss\\nBone loss can occur from the initial injury (extrusion of bone fragments or \\nsegments at the time of impact) or following wound excision in open frac -\\ntures. High- energ y trauma to the metaphysis of osteoporotic bone can lead to \\ncrushing with impaction of cancellous bone that, in effect, creates a defect even \\nwithout there being any physical removal of bone. Pathological fractures, too, \\nmay present with bone loss consequent to both the pathological process and \\nthe injury.\\nThis is an open access publication.

An antibiotic-  loaded p olymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) ce -\\nment spacer is placed and moulded to cover the bone at both ends of the defect \\nat the time of soft tissue cover or wound closure. This induces a foreign body \\nreaction producing a biologically active membrane around it that is highly vas-\\ncular and has cells producing osteogenic growth factors. The cement spacer \\nmaintains the length of the limb, provides effective dead space management, \\nand delivers a high concentration of antibiotics locally. The technique is illus-\\ntrated in Figure 9.1.\\nMaturation of the membrane (from 6– 12\\xa0we eks) is followed by a second pro-\\ncedure to remove the cement spacer and replace this with autogenous bone \\ngraft. The membrane is incised and protected when the cement spacer is ex -\\ntracted so that closure will facilitate containment of the graft material within \\nthe defect. The bone edges at either end of the defect are inspected, excised \\nfurther if needed, and sharply ‘petalled’ (osteoperiosteal and cortical leaves are \\nelevated from the surface of bone to stimulate a new inflammatory response) \\nbefore the graft is placed.\\nBone graft is obtained from the iliac crest or femoral canal (using the RIA— \\nreamer irrigator aspirator— tec hnique) as large volumes may be required (2, 3). \\nWhilst the induced membrane technique is itself an augmentation procedure \\nfor autogenous bone graft, some parties advocate addition of further adjuncts \\nsuch as bone morphogenetic proteins or bone marrow aspirate-  concen trated \\nosteoprogenitor cells.\\nGood results have been reported using this technique, particularly in the \\nupper limb and femur (1, 4). In the tibia, Masquelet has encouraged creating \\ncross- unions between the tibia and fibula at levels proximal to and distal to the \\nlevel of the defect especially when external fixation is utilised for stabilisation. \\nThis is said to reduce refractures after fixator removal.\\nThe induced membrane technique, especially when used in combination with \\ninternal fixation, may be more acceptable than prolonged external fixation and \\nbone transport. It is helpful for partial or oblique defects where, if bone trans-\\nport were performed, docking of bone ends might be troublesome. However, \\ncomplications do occur and some centres have reported less favourable results \\nin the tibia (5).\\nWhere complex plastic surgery has been performed for definitive wound \\ncover, and the induced membrane technique is considered, some pre- empt ive \\ndiscussions with plastic surgical colleagues will help in planning for access \\nthrough this cover for bone grafting.\\nThis is an open access publication.

It contains bone matrix proteins and osteo- induc tive cel-\\nlular signalling molecules including BMPs. Although some studies describe its \\nuse as a bone graft substitute and expander, clinical evidence for effectiveness \\nis weak and no studies for a role in open fracture defects exist. It is thus not re-\\ncommended at the current time (17).\\nVascularised bone\\xa0grafting\\nThe fibula, with its peroneal artery pedicle and hence vascular supply intact, is \\nthe most common bone transferred for tibial bone defects. It can be transferred \\nipsilaterally through a proximal and distal osteotomy and the intermediate seg-\\nment slowly moved across from posterolateral to anteromedial to bridge the \\ngap created from a tibial defect (18). This technique of slow transfer is achieved \\nusually in an Ilizarov fixator and is termed transverse bone transport to distin-\\nguish it from longitudinal bone transport (described in further detail later in \\nthe chapter). The gradual transfer preserves the vascularity of the fibula seg -\\nment. Alternatively, the fibula can be transferred as a vascularised graft from \\nthe contralateral leg; microsurgical anastomosis of the peroneal artery of the \\nfibula to a suitable vascular bundle in the host (recipient) leg is required to \\nre- establish the blood supply (19). An example of a free fibula microvascular \\ntransfer is shown in Figure 9.2.\\nThis form of bone replacement for tibial defects carries the advantage of long \\ndefects being adequately filled by a corresponding length of fibula. It is also \\nsuited for partial defects of the tibia in which a small circumference of the tibia \\nremains but over a long length; the fibula can be inserted and fixed to the re -\\nmaining circumference thereby avoiding conversion of the defect into a seg -\\nmental type by excising the remaining viable part (Figure 9.2).\\nThis method of replacement requires the expertise of either a surgeon trained \\nin transverse bone transport or one in free vascularised bone transfer. In the \\nlatter, considerations should be made for the impact of loss of the fibula from \\nthe contralateral leg (there can be restrictions on sports activities and prob -\\nlems with a deformity of the great toe) and the period of protection and activity \\nmodification required (usually 18\\xa0months or longer) until the transferred fibula \\nhas hypertrophied and is capable of load transfer equivalent to the intact tibia.\\nDistraction osteogenesis (DO)\\nDO is the most established method of bone regeneration for large segment bone \\nloss (20).

Rarely, \\nan open extremity fracture is associated with major haemorrhage. Importantly, \\ncontrol of catastrophic haemorrhage is now addressed at the first stage of the \\nprimary survey together with airway management and cervical spine sta -\\nbilisation, CABCDE (Circulation (exsanguinating haemorrhage), Airway, \\nBreathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure). Major haemorrhage control may \\nbe achieved by applying direct pressure to the source of major bleeding, thereby \\nmaintaining such tissue perfusion as exists. In the field, the use of a tourniquet \\nmay save lives (1). If used, the time applied must be noted or written on the tour-\\nniquet to avoid unnecessarily prolonged ischaemia in the event of successful re-\\ntrieval. Blind clamping of an actively bleeding vessel is potentially detrimental \\nto vascular tissue and accompanying nerves and should be avoided (2).\\nWhether accompanied by major haemorrhage or not, a devascularised limb \\nassociated with an open fracture, designated ‘IIIC’ by the amended Gustilo–  \\nAnderson classification (3), is a clinical emergency requiring prompt recogni-\\ntion and treatment. Recognition is based on hard clinical signs, including lack \\nof palpable pulses, continued bleeding, or an expanding haematoma (4). If pos-\\nsible, the quality of the pulses should be compared to the uninjured contralat-\\neral limb. Fractures or joint dislocations should be reduced as this may restore \\ndistal circulation. Pulses may be weak if the patient is hypovolaemic and this \\nshould be corrected. Assessment of pulses should not rely on the use of Doppler \\nultrasound and the ankle-  brachi al pressure index (ABPI) is associated with a \\nsubstantial false negative rate (4)\\xa0and inter-  obser ver variability (5). Capillary \\nrefill time is a poor indicator of vascular compromise as pooling of blood in the \\nlimb may give the impression of slow capillary return.\\nThe common injury patterns associated with loss of distal perfusion are:\\n 1.

These are often \\nclosed injuries.\\n 2. Fracture dislocations of the kn ee.\\n 3. Fracture dislocations of the ankle. The distal pulses often return following \\nreduction of the dislocation and skeletal realignment.\\n 4. Injury to all three vessels distal to the trifurcation. This vascular injury \\npattern is associated with severe soft tissue and bony injury; there is often \\nnon- viable muscle in multiple compartments and segmental bone loss. This \\npatient group may be best served by expeditious amputation (Chapter\\xa012).\\nDiagnosis\\nThere are no randomised controlled trials linking diagnostic strategy with pa-\\ntient outcomes (4). Rather, the published data report the relative sensitivities \\nand specificities of the various diagnostic strategies (CT angiography, Doppler \\nABPI <0.90) and clinical examination to a control (usually invasive angiog-\\nraphy). In this instance sensitivity is more important than specificity as the con-\\nsequences of a false negative are likely to be more severe than those of a false \\npositive (unnecessary intervention). Whilst CT angiography exhibited 100% \\nsensitivity and specificity, an error of interpretation was noted in two cases. \\nImportantly, the time required for an additional visit to the CT suite for angi-\\nography was considered to add an unacceptable delay. However, many patients \\nwith open fractures will have an early trauma CT scan and National Institute \\nfor Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest this should include \\na whole- body scanogram. This allows both the need for directed angiography \\nand fracture imaging to be assessed and then images acquired at that first visit \\nin a time- efficient ma nner. Whilst direct evidence is absent, indirect evidence \\nfavours reliance on hard signs (lack of pulses, expanding haematoma, continued \\nbleeding) for making a prompt clinical diagnosis and avoiding time- cons uming \\ndiagnostic tests that may alter the balance of ischaemic time on outcomes (4). \\nAll centres receiving these patients should have protocols in place for emergency \\nreferral for vascular assessment and reconstruction in collaboration with the \\northopaedic team. Nevertheless, some injuries will not be salvageable. Where \\nthe patient is unconscious and a primary amputation must be performed in \\norder to preserve life, the decision should be made by two consultants (2). One \\nof the most difficult dilemmas is preparing an acutely injured conscious patient \\nfor the possibility of amputation. Patients must be made aware, as sensitively \\nbut unequivocally as possible, and consent obtained at primary exploration if \\nnecessary. If surgical exploration reveals the limb to be unsalvageable, the pa-\\ntient can be scheduled for delayed primary amputation following appropriate \\nThis is an open access publication.

The delayed primary amputation should be per -\\nformed within 72\\xa0hours of injury and the decision to proceed down this route \\nshould be based on multidisciplinary assessment involving an orthopaedic sur-\\ngeon, plastic surgeon, vascular specialist, rehabilitation specialist, the patient, \\nand their family members or carers (4).\\nIschaemia\\xa0time\\nPhysiological and preclinical studies reveal that muscle damage is present at \\n3\\xa0hours ischaemia time and is near complete, and irreversible, at 6\\xa0hours (6). \\nThe experimental data are corroborated by clinical series. In a series of 17 pa -\\ntients, all those with an ischaemic time of greater than 6\\xa0hours required ampu-\\ntation eventually whilst all limbs with an ischaemic time of less than 5\\xa0hours \\nwere salvaged (7). A\\xa0meta- ana lysis of over 100 fractures with vascular injuries \\nfound that there was steep fall in limb salvage rate if the ischaemia time ex -\\ntended beyond 4\\xa0hours (8).\\nVascular\\xa0shunts\\nPopularised in 1971 (9), vascular shunts are used to establish flow to the \\ndevascularised limb prior to staged orthopaedic and vascular reconstruc-\\ntion (8–  11). The sur gical sequence of shunt rescue of the devascularised \\nlimb includes establishing proximal and distal control, intravascular lavage \\nusing heparinised saline (with Fogarty balloon catheterisation to re-  esta blish \\nflow if necessary), and the insertion of a shunt of a similar diameter to the \\ntraumatised vessel for a distance of 15–20\\xa0mm, which is then secured (12). \\nShunting has been shown to reduce complications, repeat operations, ampu -\\ntation rate, and duration of inpatient stay in a cohort of patients with blunt \\npopliteal artery injuries and distal ischaemia (7). Shunting improves limb sal -\\nvage where a major vascular injury is associated with high energy fractures \\n(13,14). Shunting is well tolerated for vascular trauma in combat, avoiding \\nthe need for definitive revascularisation in austere environments (15). As well \\nas revascularising the distal extremity, shunts minimise ongoing blood loss, \\ncombating the lethal triad of acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia in the \\ninjured patient (11,12).\\nTo avoid complicating the subsequent reconstruction of an associated open \\nfracture, access incisions to enable shunting should be planned with the re-\\nconstruction in mind and preferably with the reconstructive surgeon present. \\nInjuries to the popliteal vessels are best accessed via a curvilinear incision in the \\npopliteal fossa that provides direct access above and below the site of vascular \\ninjury (16).\\nThis is an open access publication.

Following skeletal stabilisation definitive vascular repair can be \\nperformed expeditiously using a reversed vein graft (17). Forearm veins are \\noften superior to the saphenous vein as they can be harvested by a second team, \\ntend to be the appropriate diameter, and are not as muscular as the saphenous \\nand, hence, are less prone to spasm. The revascularised limb is at high risk of \\ndeveloping compartment syndrome and there should be a low threshold for de-\\ncompression of all four compartments of the leg (Chapter\\xa011).\\nVenous\\xa0repair\\nProximal venous injuries, including the femoral and popliteal, should be re -\\npaired at the same time as the arterial injuries. Whilst the collateral venous \\nsystem may suffice in the short term, over time the poor venous return leads to \\nthe development of post- phle bitic changes (18). Proximal venous repairs are as-\\nsociated with high patency rates, with only venous repairs distal to the popliteal \\nvein suffering from early thrombosis (18).\\nNerve\\xa0repair\\nA high index of suspicion for associated nerve injury is essential, especially \\nin an unconscious patient. When a sharp nerve transection is encountered it \\nshould be ideally repaired at the same operation to avoid subsequent surgical \\nexploration in the vicinity of the vascular repair and the accompanying scar \\ntissue surrounding it (19). For larger nerves, knowledge of nerve topography \\nand intraoperative fascicle stimulation are helpful to achieve anatomical ap -\\nproximation. If the nerve is sharply transected but with segmental loss, a inter-\\nposition nerve graft is necessary (19).

Consequently, prompt diagnosis \\nand decompression may save limbs. A\\xa0missed diagnosis is associated with sig-\\nnificant morbidity arising from the ischaemic necrosis and, sometimes, putre-\\nfaction of tissues within the compartment. Late decompression, after the stage \\nwhen tissue can be rescued, should be avoided because of the risks of infection \\nand reperfusion injury.\\nThe principles described in the foregoing account apply to the upper and \\nlower limb except for the hand and foot.\\nMaking the\\xa0diagnosis\\nAn increased awareness of the condition, particularly with some fracture types, \\nand repeated clinical assessments and intracompartmental pressure meas -\\nurements will enable early diagnosis and treatment. Heightened vigilance is \\nrecommended for young adults with mid-  diap hyseal tibial fractures, tibial \\nplateau fractures, or proximal tibial fractures associated with knee dislocation \\n(2, 3). These injury types have a higher association with acute compartment \\nsyndrome, possibly from the high- energ y nature of the underlying mechanisms \\nproducing greater soft tissue disruption. The key to making an accurate diag -\\nnosis is the serial collation of signs and symptoms. The greater the number of \\npositive features, the more likely is the diagnosis to be accurate, especially if this \\nis repeated over a short period of observation. Whilst a single positive finding \\nhas a probability of an accurate diagnosis of 25%, three findings increase this \\nprobability to 93% (4).\\nAn important feature of compartment syndrome in the conscious patient is se-\\nvere pain that is out of proportion to the injury and that fails to improve in the ex-\\npected time course after surgery or after a judicious dose of analgesics. The pain is \\nexacerbated by passive stretching of the muscles of the affected compartment but \\nthis sign is not valuable in children, who are influenced by apprehension and fear \\nof pain. The classic five Ps of compartment syndrome (pain, pallor, paraesthesia, \\npulselessness, and paralysis) are not relevant to an early diagnosis of the condi-\\ntion; if anything, waiting for all five Ps would inevitably lead to a late diagnosis. Of \\nthe five, pain, paraesthesia, and weakness (paralysis) are likely to be found early \\nand a clinical examination should look for signs of nerve impairment, e.g. sensory \\nloss within the areas supplied by nerves traversing the involved compartments.

Eliciting \\nclinical signs can be difficult in non-  comp liant patients and young children. \\nIn such scenarios, continuous measurement of intracompartmental pressure \\nhas its advocates (5). In the unconscious or non-  comp liant patient, it may be \\nthe only available clinical parameter. The pressure is measured using purpose- \\nmade devices, which are solid state transducer intracompartmental catheters \\n(STIC, Stryker, USA) or transducer- tip ped catheters (Omnibar E5F , Raumedic, \\nGermany). Both produce similar readings but single measurements should be \\nused cautiously; corroborative clinical signs or repeated measurements help \\nadd weight to the diagnosis of compartment syndrome (6). The commonly used \\nthreshold for decompression in adults is when the perfusion pressure (diastolic \\npressure minus intracompartmental pressure) is less than 30\\xa0mmHg, especially \\nwhen sustained for more than 2\\xa0hours. In a consecutive series of over 900 adults \\nwith tibial fractures, the sensitivity and specificity for making the diagnosis \\nwith this threshold were 94% and 98%, respectively, and led to fasciotomies in \\n18% (5). The balance between a prompt diagnosis and unnecessary fasciotomy \\ncan be difficult; both untreated compartment syndrome and unneeded sur -\\ngery carry morbidity (7–  9). Addit ionally, this perfusion pressure threshold \\ncan be unsuitable for young children who have diastolic blood pressures be -\\ntween 40 and 55\\xa0mmHg (this would suggest intracompartmental pressures of \\n10– 25\\xa0mmHg would then prompt a fasciotomy). The incidence of acute com-\\npartment syndrome is lower in young children (<12\\xa0years) and may occur as \\nlate as 65\\xa0hours after injury (10). The recommendation for young children is to \\nuse serial clinical examination repeated over brief intervals whilst the limb is \\nnursed flat and to note if there has been a record of increasing analgesic needs \\n(11, 12).\\nTreatment\\nSurgery to decompress the four compartments in the leg is the only treatment \\navailable; whilst preparing for surgery it is prudent to confirm that all circum-\\nferential dressings have been divided. Long incisions through skin and fascia are \\nneeded to decompress adequately and allow extrusion of the increased muscle \\nbulk. Subcutaneous incisions in the fascia through shorter skin incisions are \\nnot recommended (13). We recommend the two-  incisio n technique (14, 15). \\nThe positions of the incisions are different from classic descriptions (16); this \\nrepresents a deliberate attempt to facilitate soft tissue cover of open fractures by \\npreserving perforators arising from axial vessels such that local fasciocutaneous \\nflap options remain viable (Figure 11.1a–  d).

The surface anatomy— tib ial crest and \\nposteromedial border— for t he placement of the two skin incisions can be diffi-\\ncult to define in a swollen limb but careful palpation will reveal these contours.\\nThere has been a resurgence of interest in single incision fasciotomies for \\ndecompression of all four compartments (17, 18). We do not advocate the tech-\\nnique:\\xa0reaching all four compartments from a single lateral incision involves \\nundermining the skin anteriorly and posteriorly. This degloves the skin and can \\npose potential problems for wound healing in a zone of injury. The two- incisio n \\ntechnique decompresses by allowing the greater volume of contents (muscle) \\nwithin the compartments to spill out and thereby occupy a larger space.\\nMuscle viability must be checked after compartment decompression and \\nexcised if necrotic. If all devitalised tissue is removed, we favour immediate \\ncoverage with meshed, split thickness grafts secured with a negative pressure \\nfoam dressing using pressures of 50– 70\\xa0mmHg o nly. This provides cover to the \\nwounds and fracture with immediate effect. If closure is to be delayed because \\nof uncertainty over tissue viability, a temporary dressing is applied (19). Return \\nto theatre for final inspection, wound excision, and definitive fracture cover \\nshould be accomplished within 72\\xa0hours.\\nA late diagnosis of compartment syndrome and subsequent fasciotomy can \\nlead to severe infection, renal failure and death (20–  22). The definit ion of late \\ndiagnosis is unclear and there is evidence that even by 3\\xa0hours after trauma \\nthere is muscle necrosis (23). This suggests there may be varying degrees of the \\ncondition and that our current tools for establishing the diagnosis—  whet her \\nclinical features or pressure measurements—  are s urrogates for the cell death \\noccurring from impaired tissue perfusion. Newer modalities are being investi-\\ngated and include near- infrar ed spectrometry and tissue ultrafiltration samples \\n(24); at present, clinical examination and compartment pressure measurement \\nremain at the forefront of diagnosis (25).\\nThere is controversy over how best to manage a late presentation of compart-\\nment syndrome in adults as decompression enables reperfusion of necrotic \\nmuscle and leads to a rhabdomyolysis syndrome. Leaving the compartments \\nclosed will allow the necrosis to complete without reperfusion; this may be a \\nsafer prospect (26). Conversely there are those who advocate decompression \\neven if the diagnosis is late but with removal of necrotic muscle (to the extent \\nof compartment removal, if necessary, leaving the traversing neurovascular \\nbundles intact). There is insufficient evidence to provide clear guidance but \\na late decompression without removal of necrotic muscle will lead to greater \\nmorbidity, and potentially death, from reperfusion and rhabdomyolysis. \\nThis is an open access publication.

The surgeon’s responsibility is heightened by the \\nknowledge that delayed or incorrect decision-  mak ing may lead to worse out -\\ncomes (1). Unfortunately, hard data upon which to base reliable decisions re -\\nmain elusive. A\\xa0prospective analysis of the use of scoring systems including the \\nLimb Salvage Index, the Predictive Salvage Index, the Hanover Fracture Scale, \\nand the NISSSA (Nerve injury, Ischaemia, Soft-  tis sue contamination, Skeletal \\ndamage, Shock, Age) and MESS (Mangled Extremity Severity Score) scores did \\nnot validate the clinical utility of any of the scoring algorithms (2, 3).\\nA number of studies, including two meta- ana lyses, have shown the final out-\\ncomes of amputation after trauma are similar to the outcomes after limb sal -\\nvage, with high rates of long-  term di sability reported in both patient groups \\n(4– 6). More recent research has focused on injury and patient factors that may \\nimpact on the final functional outcome after both amputation and limb salvage \\n(1, 6, 7). We advocate early identification of poor prognostic factors as the basis \\nfor the decision to amputate or salvage.\\nResuscitation and limb\\xa0assessment\\nA severe limb- thre atening injury is usually obvious and can be a distraction to \\nthe assessment and resuscitation of the patient. Up to 17% of patients with se-\\nvere limb trauma will have associated life- thre atening injuries, which must be \\nidentified and treated according to the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) \\nprinciples of ABCDE (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) \\n(8), but also consider that the limb injury itself may be life- thre atening. A\\xa0thor-\\nough limb examination is only performed after the airway is secured and the \\ncardiopulmonary function is stable. Haemorrhage from the limb is tradition-\\nally assessed during C (Circulation) of the primary survey and is addressed \\nby either direct pressure or the judicious use of a tourniquet. However, more \\nrecently, the need to deal with catastrophic haemorrhage at an earlier stage has \\nbeen recognised in the sequence CABCDE.\\nImmediate primary\\xa0amputation\\nThere are a number of uncommon injury scenarios when immediate ampu -\\ntation is indicated. Incomplete traumatic amputation involving almost com -\\nplete severance of the limb, often accompanied by extensive injury to the distal \\nsegment, requires prompt surgical completion of the amputation.

Operative photographs are valuable documentary \\nevidence of the extent of the limb injury and should be taken and stored in the \\npatient’s record (9).\\nGuillotine amputations are to be avoided as they sacrifice residual limb length \\nand viable tissue. Viable muscle and skin flaps should be retained whenever \\npossible (10). Wounds should not be formally closed and the use of negative-  \\npressure wound therapy dressings is recommended. If immediate amputation \\nis required for life- thre atening injuries, complete documentation of the extent \\nof the injury with intra- opera tive photographs will be helpful in explaining the \\ndecision to the patient and their family.\\nDecision- making\\xa0variables\\nThe decision to amputate or reconstruct a severely injured extremity should be \\nbased on an analysis of the characteristics of the limb injury and the physiological \\nreserve of the patient (Box 12.1). A\\xa0multidisciplinary discussion involving an \\northopaedic surgeon, a plastic surgeon, rehabilitation specialist, the patient, \\nand their family or carers is essential whenever possible before embarking on \\nsurgery. A\\xa0recent meta- ana lysis of prognostic factors associated with amputa-\\ntion following repair of lower extremity vascular trauma highlighted a number \\nof factors associated with an increased risk of secondary amputation (11). Risk \\nfactors for amputation included major soft tissue injury, compartment syn-\\ndrome, an ischaemic time beyond 6\\xa0hours and age over 55\\xa0years.\\nLimb\\xa0ischaemia\\nReperfusion of an ischaemic limb needs to be achieved within 4– 6\\xa0ho urs of in-\\njury (see Chapter\\xa010). However, the precise time of injury may not have been \\nestablished and the ischaemic threshold may be reduced if the patient has been \\npersistently hypotensive (12).\\nNeurological\\xa0injury\\nHistorically, the absence of plantar sensation in the traumatised limb was con-\\nsidered an indication for amputation due to risk of development of neuro -\\npathic ulcers and other chronic complications associated with an insensate \\nfoot. However, a study comparing patients presenting with an insensate foot \\nThis is an open access publication.

Soft tissue damage may be caused by the \\ninjury, ischaemia, or by compartment syndrome. Localised muscle damage can \\nbe offset by muscle transfers, e.g. transfer of tibialis posterior for peroneal or an-\\nterior compartment muscle loss. However, more extensive muscle loss, particu-\\nlarly affecting the posterior compartment muscles, usually results in poor final \\nfunction and amputation should be considered. Severe wound contamination \\nis often associated with major soft tissue loss because of the need for aggressive \\nand repeated wound excision.\\nExtensive soft tissue damage almost inevitably results in a scarred and atro-\\nphic limb with compromised function and an early amputation may be in the \\nbest long- term interest of the patient.\\nAssociated foot and ankle trauma.\\nSevere open tibial fractures are occasionally associated with ipsilateral crush \\ninjuries of the foot and ankle. A\\xa0high proportion of patients continue to have \\nneuropathic pain and poor function despite successful salvage and treatment \\nof crush- type foot injuries (14). Studies of multiply injured patients with foot \\ninjuries found significantly worse functional outcome scores compared with \\nthose without foot injuries (15, 16). Based on these data, amputation may pro-\\nvide better long- term functional outcomes in patients presenting with a severe \\nopen tibial fracture and concomitant severe ipsilateral foot trauma.\\nBone\\xa0loss\\nExtensive bone defects can be successfully managed by a number of techniques, \\nincluding autogenous bone grafting, vascularised fibula grafts, or distraction \\nosteogenesis (see Chapter\\xa09). However, the healing index (number of months \\nof treatment per centimetre of new bone) is high. A\\xa05\\xa0cm defect can be suc -\\ncessfully restored by distraction osteogenesis over approximately 8– 9\\xa0mo nths. \\nReconstruction of larger bone defects will take over 12\\xa0 months and involve \\nmultiple operations. In addition, the patient will need to be compliant, motiv-\\nated, have good social support, and ideally a non-  smok er.

Similar results were reported in a recent sys -\\ntemic review, which found smoking significantly increased the overall risk for \\nnon- union, particularly in tibial and open fractures (18). Smoking may also \\nadversely affect soft tissue reconstruction. Two recent meta-  ana lyses have re-\\nvealed significantly increased risks of cutaneous necrosis, delayed wound \\nhealing, and surgical site infections in smokers (19, 20).\\nTiming of\\xa0delayed primary\\xa0amputation\\nIn practice, most severe limb injuries are suitable for staged management. \\nMarginally viable tissue may take hours to demarcate and an evolving injury \\ncan be definitively declared unsalvageable at 48\\xa0hours.

Involvement of a multidis-\\nciplinary limb rehabilitation team is crucial, including patients who have com-\\npleted their rehabilitation.\\nOnce the decision has been reached, amputation should be performed as \\nsoon as possible and within 72\\xa0hours of injury (3).\\nCommon injury scenarios where delayed primary amputation should be \\nconsidered include a major open tibia fracture with a severe foot injury, seg -\\nmental bone loss involving more than a third of the tibial shaft, loss of two or \\nmore muscle compartments, and an ischaemia limb with a proven nerve injury.\\nResidual limb\\xa0reconstruction\\nThe aim of residual limb (‘stump’) reconstruction is the preservation of max -\\nimal limb length whilst ensuring adequate soft tissue cover (1). Maintaining \\nlength in the presence of widespread tissue damage is a major challenge and \\nin practice the most distal level of viable soft tissue dictates the amputation \\nlength. Amputation at the level of the fracture site should be avoided if viable \\ndistal bone is present, and proximal fractures should be managed with standard \\nfixation techniques (21). The bone ends should be beveled to remove jagged \\nedges, which may cause local discomfort. The construction of a bone bridge \\nbetween the tibia and shortened fibular (Ertl technique) has been proposed for \\nyounger amputees but conflicting data are present in the literature and com-\\nparative studies are lacking (1, 22).\\nSoft tissue reconstruction aims to provide durable and comfortable padding \\nover the bone ends, and to restore muscular control of the leg (1).

The advantages of a TKA over an above- kne e amputation (AKA) in am-\\nbulatory patients include an end weight- bea ring residual limb, enhanced pro-\\nprioception, preserved adductor muscle insertion, a longer lever arm, and \\ndecreased metabolic cost of ambulation compared with AKA (26, 27). The \\nGritti– Stokes modification of knee disarticulation may offer improved weight- \\nbearing characteristics in the trauma patient (27). In patients unlikely to am-\\nbulate, a TKA maximises ease of transfers because the limb is end- bea ring and \\nfacilitates wheelchair mobility by providing better counterbalance due to the \\nlonger residual limb (26).\\nAlthough the LEAP study reported poor outcomes in a small cohort of 18 pa-\\ntients, a recent meta- ana lysis of 27 studies comprising 3105 traumatic amputees \\nincluding 104 TKA, revealed significantly superior Physical Component Scores \\nin patients with TKA compared with trans- femo ral amputees (6). In addition, \\nthe proportion of TKA patients who could walk at least 500\\xa0 m was slightly \\ngreater than patients with trans- tib ial amputations and significantly more than \\ntrans- femoral amputees.\\nHowever, the study also found that patients with a TKA wore their prostheses \\nsignificantly less and reported significantly more pain than those with trans-  \\nfemoral amputation, which was attributed to potential suboptimal soft tissue \\ncoverage and prosthetic fitting difficulties (6). TKA is also associated with knee- \\nlevel asymmetry, most marked when seated and the lower knee joint axis may \\ncomplicate gait training. It has been suggested that the greater length of the \\nTKA provides a superior lever arm, which confers greater mobility than a trans- \\nfemoral amputation, with less impact on the quality of life (6).

Management \\nis primarily surgical, with prompt drainage of fluid collections and aggres -\\nsive wound excision of necrotic and devascularised tissue with multiple op-\\nerative biopsies for microbial analysis.

Pre-  amp utation and residual limb pain plus psy -\\nchological factors such as emotional stress and anxiety probably all contribute \\nto the development of phantom limb pain (6). Early administration of effective \\nanalgesia as soon after injury as possible will not only control acute pain but \\nmay also reduce the risk of chronic pain. Pre-  empt ive analgesia is also indi -\\ncated to prevent the establishment of central sensitisation and pain memories \\nevoked by surgery and early mobilisation. Although a randomised study of epi-\\ndural anaesthesia for elective amputation cases showed no benefit (32), the an-\\nalgesia was not truly pre- empt ive as central nervous system changes may have \\nalready been established and epidural anaesthesia may have a role in acute pain \\nmanagement.\\nPsychological\\xa0response\\nAn intense emotional response following traumatic amputation is common \\nand psychological disorders such as post-  traum atic stress disorder (PTSD) \\nanxiety, depression, and substance abuse affect more than half of amputees in \\nthe longer term (33).

Revision amputation should be \\nconsidered when non- opera tive measures fail. A\\xa0retrospective review of 71 re-\\nvision cases reported improvement in 66% of confirmed neuromas, over 80% of \\npatients with bone pathology, and 70% of patients with soft tissue problems (35).\\nRehabilitation\\nThe importance of rehabilitation in delivering good functional outcomes is evi-\\ndenced by the startling results of the Military Extremity Trauma Amputation/ \\nLimb Salvage (METALS) study (24). Unlike the LEAP study, which found \\nsimilar outcomes in civilians treated by amputation or limb salvage (36), mili-\\ntary personnel undergoing amputation had significantly improved functional \\noutcomes compared with those treated with limb salvage. Furthermore, unilat-\\neral and bilateral amputees were nearly three times more likely to be engaged in \\na vigorous sports or recreational activity than limb salvage patients and were less \\nlikely to screen positive for post- traum atic stress. The researchers suggested that \\nthe results might be explained by the focused rehabilitation military amputees \\nreceive early in their recovery and the ready access to optimal prostheses and \\nrobust reintegration programmes. In addition, military amputees are generally \\nyoung and fit and may also have greater access to peer and external support early \\nin their recovery, which may result in better outcomes. The benefit of a compre-\\nhensive extremity rehabilitation programme was also demonstrated in a series of \\nlimb salvage patients with severe traumatic lower extremity deficits (37).\\nConclusion\\nSurgical advances have provided the means to reconstruct injuries that would \\nhave been previously amenable only to amputation. However, the surgeon’s de-\\nsire for reconstruction and the patient’s wish for limb salvage must be balanced \\nby the poor results of failed limb salvage and the good outcomes of successful \\namputation. An understanding of the therapeutic variables that affect outcome \\nafter both limb salvage and limb amputation will provide a platform for informed \\ndecision- making and will maximise the likelihood of a successful outcome.\\nReferences\\n 1.

Although there is evidence of a possible reduction in incidence \\nin the past decade (4), the Lower Extremity Assessment Project (LEAP) study \\nhas shown that severe lower extremity trauma continues to be associated with \\ninfective complications necessitating additional operative treatment in a sig-\\nnificant number of cases (5). Furthermore, greater bacterial virulence and \\nincreasing age and associated co- morb idities of the fracture population ensure \\nthat infection after open trauma remains a challenge.\\nDefinition and\\xa0classification\\nThere are no agreed criteria for diagnosing fracture infection (3, 6). The Centers \\nfor Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for surgical site infection (SSI) are often \\nquoted but the complexity of an infected fracture is not covered by these guide-\\nlines (3, 7). Although comprehensive definitions are lacking, there is an ac -\\ncepted classification of infection after trauma according to the time of onset, \\nwhich reflects the extent of biofilm formation and fracture- hea ling status, with \\nimplications for treatment (3, 8).\\n 1. Early infections (less than 2\\xa0 weeks) are easily diagnosed clinically since \\nthe classic signs of infection (swelling, redness, pain) are usually present in \\naddition to delayed wound healing and drainage, haematoma, and accom -\\npanying pyrexia. Virulent organisms, like Staphylococcus aureus are common \\npathogens and an immature biofilm may be present (9). Osteomyelitis and \\naccompanying inflammation and osteolysis will not have developed and \\nfracture instability is unlikely at this early stage (3).\\n 2. Delayed infections (2–  10\\xa0 we eks) may be associated with signs consistent \\nwith either early or late infection but infections are typically due to less viru-\\nlent organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (9). The biofilm is more \\nmature and relatively resistant to antibiotic therapy and host defences. In \\naddition, bacterial bone invasion and osteomyelitis will be more advanced, \\nwith implications for fracture healing and stability (10, 11).\\n 3. Late- onset infections (more than 10\\xa0weeks) are characterised by subtle signs \\nof infection, without systemic manifestation, and are usually caused by low- \\nvirulence organisms (9). Fracture healing may be complete or incomplete \\nbut chronic inflammation (osteomyelitis) causes local tissue damage and \\nosteolysis potentially leading to fixation instability, with implications for the \\nresidual hardware. Periosteal new bone produces an involucrum in response \\nto the persistent low- grade infla mmation caused by the infection and these \\nchanges often necessitate extensive and repeated wound excision, resulting \\nin bone-  and soft tissue defects (12).\\nThis is an open access publication.

Delayed \\nwound healing and drainage or an active sinus are definitive signs of infection. \\nPersistent elevation or a secondary rise in C- reac tive protein is a useful indicator \\nof infection (13). Plain radiology findings are usually normal in early infection \\nand callus formation and the presence of hardware may mask the later subtle \\nradiological features of infection (14). Whilst serial radiographs are useful to \\nassess fracture healing and implant stability, computed tomography (CT) pro-\\nvides more bone architecture detail as well as signs of implant loosening (3). \\nMarkers for active infection such as cortical reaction, sequestra, sinuses, and \\nabscess formation in the adjacent soft tissue may also be evident on CT scans \\n(15). Whilst magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful to evaluate soft tissue \\ninvolvement and intramedullary infection, metal artefacts, bone oedema, and \\nscarring may mimic infection and impair correct evaluation (16).\\nNuclear imaging modalities are sensitive but not specific, especially when \\nunderlying bone abnormalities are present and discrimination between infec-\\ntion and post-  traum atic bone formation is difficult (3, 17). Hybrid imaging \\n(single- photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/ CT) ca n localise the \\nsuspected infection and facilitate the discrimination between bone-   and s oft  \\ntissue infection.

Infection is usually due to metabolically \\nquiescent bacteria growing in protected biofilms on the metal implants and in \\nnecrotic bone, which makes the pathogens difficult to identify using traditional \\nculture techniques (19). At least three tissue biopsies should be taken in regions \\nof perceived infection such as necrotic bone tissue or non- unions a nd around \\nthe implant (9).

An effective wound \\nexcision combined with high- dose an tibiotics achieves a rapid reduction in the \\nbacterial load (3).

Wound excision should not be \\nlimited by concerns of creating a bone or soft tissue defect because failing to \\nexcise compromised tissues may leave viable bacterial behind within the bio-\\nfilm, which will lead to recurrence of the disease (31, 32).

Alternatively, negative pressure dressings are employed between \\nserial wound excision prior to definitive soft tissue cover.\\nAntimicrobial\\xa0therapy\\nInitial intravenous broad- spe ctrum therapy is started after multiple microbial \\nsamples have been obtained at wound excision and continued until the patho-\\ngens and their sensitivities are identified. The duration of intravenous therapy \\ndepends on pathogen virulence and antibiotic sensitivities, as well as the initial \\nhost response to treatment. Patients with clinically infected wounds but nega-\\ntive cultures should be treated aggressively with empirical coverage for Gram \\npositive and Gram negative microbes, including MRSA (24).\\nAfter a minimum of 2\\xa0weeks’ intravenous therapy, a switch to oral therapy \\nwith good bioavailability can be considered (33, 34).\\nIf the hardware is retained, the aim of antibiotic therapy is suppression of \\nthe infection until the fracture has healed and the hardware can be removed \\n(9). However, curative treatment with implant retention is only effective with \\na biofilm- active antibiotic, such as rifampicin against Staphylococci and quin-\\nolones against Gram negative organisms (Box 13.2) (35– 37). Rifam picin must \\nbe combined with a second antibiotic to prevent the development of resistance. \\nQuinolones such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin are effective oral partners to \\nrifampicin against Staphylococci\\n (38). Bacteria resistant to biofilm- acti ve anti-\\nbiotics will not be eradicated if the internal fixation is retained and hardware \\nremoval is strongly recommended (1, 3).\\nApplication of antimicrobials at the site of infection can achieve high local \\nantibiotic concentrations, which may be useful in cases with impaired vascu -\\nlarity and as an aid for dead- space m anagement (3). Common carries include \\nnon- resorbable polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and resorbable materials \\nsuch as calcium sulfate. However, there is no clear evidence for the addition of \\nlocal antibiotics to systemic therapy. In addition, colonisation of bone cement, \\nparticularly after antibiotics have been eluted, may promote ongoing infection \\nor even induce antibiotic resistance (39) and calcium sulfate preparations may \\nbe associated with chronic wound discharge (3).\\nEarly\\xa0infection\\nHardware colonisation and biofilm formation are relatively immature (40, \\n41)\\xa0and retention of the fixation device may be considered as wound excision \\nwill reduce the bacterial load and may clear an immature biofilm and systemic \\nantibiotics will treat the remainder of the infection. However a number of pre-\\nrequisites must be fulfilled (Box 13.2). Effective wound excision and irrigation \\nmust be performed, which may not be possible with intramedullary fixation. \\nThis is an open access publication.

Once the fracture has healed, \\nimplant removal is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection (44).\\nDelayed\\xa0infection\\nThe biofilm is more mature and osteomyelitis is becoming increasingly estab-\\nlished and the surgical decision-  mak ing should tend towards radical wound \\nexcision and implant revision, particularly if there has been a delay in diagnosis \\nand treatment or if infection has recurred after initial therapy. In a study of \\npatients who developed infection within 6\\xa0weeks of fracture fixation treated \\nwith wound excision, antibiotics, and hardware retention, fracture healing \\nwas achieved in only 71% of the patients. In addition, open fractures and \\nintramedullary fixation were predictors for treatment failure (45).

In addi tion, involucra and fibrous tissue in the infected \\narea act as a barrier around necrotic bone necessitating an extensive wound ex-\\ncision with possible creation of bone-  and s oft tissue defects.

The initial management of a child’s open fracture is the same as is recom -\\nmended for adults. There is no evidence children have greater resistance to \\ninfection once the barrier of soft tissue cover of the fracture has been com-\\npromised by injury.\\n 2. The soft tissues of children do not have a greater regenerative potential and \\nsoft tissue reconstruction techniques involve the same strategies as in adults.\\n 3. Fracture fixation will need to consider the presence of physes. Flexible \\nintramedullary nails, Kirschner wires, plates introduced by minimally inva-\\nsive methods, and external fixators have their indications.\\n 4. Bone loss in very young children (under 6\\xa0years) may be managed expect -\\nantly if the defect is small as spontaneous periosteal bone formation may \\noccur. In older children, bone replacement by autografts or bone regener -\\nation methods is required.\\n 5. Skeletal injuries in children older than 12\\xa0years behave as in adults and have \\nhigher complication rates. Delayed or non- unions w ill require a more active \\ntreatment strategy.\\nTiming of\\xa0wound excision after\\xa0injury\\nAn early publication reported a halving of infection rates in children with \\nopen fractures if debrided within 6\\xa0hours of injury (1). This was contested by \\na multicentre review of 554 open paediatric fractures where there was no sig -\\nnificant difference in the incidence of infection when wound excision was per-\\nformed on either side of the 6-  hour threshold (2). A\\xa0recent publication from \\nthe UK that reported compliance with the last issue of Standards of Treatment \\n(British Orthopaedic Association/ Bri tish Association of Plastic, Reconstructive \\nand Aesthetic Surgeons (BOA/ BAPR AS)) in 2009 had antibiotics given intra -\\nvenously on arrival in the emergency department and had all injuries debrided \\non the day of admission or the next day if the patient arrived after midnight. The \\ninjuries were managed jointly by orthopaedic and plastic surgery consultants. \\nThis is an open access publication.

With flexible \\nintramedullary nails, choosing the suitable injury type is important; stability de-\\npends on an intact soft tissue envelope and these nails are less effective for stabil-\\nisation in children over 50\\xa0kg weight (7). For those injury patterns and patients \\nwhere this method is considered suitable, immediate flexible nailing and pri-\\nmary wound closure is associated with a low rate of complications.

In fractures contaminated heavily at \\nthe time of injury, definitive external fixation is recommended.\\nSoft tissue\\xa0reconstruction\\nSeveral studies have confirmed early definitive soft tissue cover is as necessary \\nfor children as it is for adults (3, 9, 12–  15). Del ayed involvement of a plastic \\nsurgeon in management leads to more complications (14). The choice of cover \\nwill depend on the size and location of the defect, local tissue conditions, and \\nthe zone of injury. Split-  thick ness skin grafts, local fasciocutaneous, and free \\nflaps are used. The overriding principles are the same as for adults and in -\\nclude:\\xa0wound extension by incision; meticulous excision of contaminated and \\ndevitalised tissues; and early definitive cover (16). Grade 3B and 3C injuries are \\nparticularly challenging and demand the highest levels of input from all areas. \\nA\\xa0systematic review of free tissue transfer for open tibial fractures in children \\nfound that the commonest choice appears to be muscle flaps followed by per -\\nforator flaps. There is an increasing use of perforator flaps (e.g. anterolateral \\nthigh flap) citing advantages of consistent anatomy, reduced donor site mor -\\nbidity, and the supply of durable native skin that is ideal for the foot and ankle \\nregions. The overall free flap failure rate for children’s open tibial fractures is \\nsimilar to that for adults at approximately 5% (12).\\nBone\\xa0reconstruction\\nBone defects occur from loss at the scene of injury or after wound excision. The \\ncritical size of the defect that results in a non-  union in chi ldren is unknown \\nbut it is recognised that young children can bridge defects from periosteal new \\nbone formation in a manner that occurs rarely in adults (6). In very young chil-\\ndren (possibly under 6\\xa0years) an expectant approach in the first 6\\xa0weeks after \\ndefinitive stabilisation and wound closure may be taken if serial radiographs \\nindicate increasing contributions of periosteal new bone formation across the \\ndefect, thereby avoiding further surgery (17). In older children, and certainly \\nthose over the age of 11\\xa0years (18), these defects should be managed by autolo-\\ngous bone grafts or through bone regeneration using distraction osteogenesis. \\nThe choice of technique will depend on the size of the defect, soft tissue enve -\\nlope for bone grafting, availability of autogenous graft material, and familiarity \\nof the surgeon with the techniques of bone transport or acute shortening across \\nthe defect and bone lengthening from an osteotomy at a different level (9, 19). \\nSmall defects of <3\\xa0cm where the underlying bone and covering soft tissue are \\namenable to further surgery may be treated simply with autologous bone graft  \\nharvested from the posterior iliac crest.\\nThis is an open access publication.

Healing in young children is different; fracture union \\ntimes are shorter. However, there is evidence to suggest this advantage is lost by \\nthe age of 10– 12\\xa0ye ars and, especially with high- energ y tibial fractures, there is \\nan increasing likelihood for complications including non- union (3, 16, 17, 20, \\n21). Overall infection rates across the fracture types can vary between 3 and 8% \\n(17, 18, 22). These figures may mislead as Gustilo– Ander son type I\\xa0and II frac-\\ntures are the most common and do not usually become infected. Infection rates \\nare higher with Gustilo– Ander son type IIIB fractures and can reach 21% (23, \\n24). However, the combined orthoplastic approach as advocated here resulted \\nin deep infection rates of less than 7% for type IIIB fractures in children (3).\\nConclusion\\nThere are greater similarities than differences when the treatment of open tibial \\nfractures in children is compared with adults. The emphasis remains on early \\nantibiotic administration, prompt and meticulous wound excision by ortho -\\npaedic and plastic surgery consultants, and early definitive soft tissue cover. It is \\nimportant to note that children do not have an enhanced regenerative capacity \\nin their soft tissues and, as in adults, all non-  via ble tissue should be excised. \\nThe techniques for soft tissue reconstruction in children are the same as with \\nadults. The method of fracture stabilisation can vary depending on the fracture \\npattern and location, degree of contamination, presence of bone loss, and age \\nof the child. Very young children may recover from bone loss spontaneously \\nby periosteal new bone formation. Older children will require bone grafting or \\nbone regeneration.\\nReferences\\n 1. Kreder HJ.

It is also referred to as a \\nconstruct, domain, or concept. In a clinical trial it refers to what is being meas-\\nured on participants to examine the effect of the intervention (2). An outcome \\nmeasurement instrument (OMI) refers to how the outcome is measured. It is a \\ntool to measure the quality or quantity of an outcome (2)\\xa0(e.g. the Oxford Hip \\nScore).

The World Health \\nOrganization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and \\nHealth model (ICF) identifies multiple interrelated domains of disability af -\\nfecting a patient’s recovery. In the context of a severe lower limb injury these \\ncan be divided into impairments of body functions and structure, together with \\nactivity limitations and restrictions to participation that are influenced by the \\nenvironment and personal factors (3). A\\xa0common approach to assessing the \\nmulti- dimensional aspects of recovery in patients with open fractures of the \\nlower limb is to use multiple outcome measures, aiming to capture different \\ndomains of health (4). Consequently, a battery of OMIs are often combined, \\nincluding both general quality-  of- life q uestionnaires and disease-   or limb- \\nspecific instruments (5).\\nIncreasingly, outcome measures should be patient- deriv ed in an endeavour \\nto focus on the relevant domains that enable better patient-  centr ed care. The \\nCore Outcomes in Clinical Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative promotes \\nefforts to involve stakeholders, including patients, to reach a consensus on the \\nmost important outcomes to collect as a minimum in a specified disease en -\\ntity. This is called a core outcome set (COS), which identifies what outcomes to \\nmeasure. A\\xa0Core Outcome Measurement Instrument Set (COMIS) identifies \\nhow to measure the COS, i.e. which OMIs to use. By establishing a consensus \\nover what the most important outcomes are and how to measure them, consist-\\nency of outcome reporting across trials and clinical audit will be improved (1). \\nIn addition, future studies are more likely to measure appropriate outcomes, \\nmaximise the potential to contribute to systematic review and meta-  ana lysis, \\nand reduce selective outcome reporting in the future (1).\\nDifferent types of\\xa0outcome\\xa0measures\\nOutcome measures can be divided into different types:\\n 1. objective clinical measures\\n 2. patient- reported outcome measures (PROMs)\\n a. general health and quality of life\\n b. disease/ reg ion- sp ecific\\n 3. physical performance measures.\\nThis is an open access publication.

This can be assessed easily and directly in a \\nvariety of ways including a simple 10-  meter t imed walk test, self-  paced wa lk \\ntest, or 6-  minut e walk test (28). There are also PPMs of other mobility tasks \\nsuch as the stair climbing, chair stand, and timed up and go tests (28); however, \\nthese activities can be viewed as extensions of walking (34). Typically, simple \\nwalking measures focus on gait speed, which has been demonstrated to be a \\nstrong indicator of pathology (35, 36). This can be performed on patients with \\ncognitive impairments where PROMs may not be feasible. Despite the practi-\\ncalities of performing simple timed walk tests in the clinic, these are limited by \\nan inability to discriminate between normal and pathological gait in situations \\nwhere patients adopt a compensatory gait pattern in order to maintain vel -\\nocity (37). This inability can be overcome by comprehensive gait analysis using \\nmodern measurement apparatus, thus enabling the capture of detailed aspects \\nof movement on walking (34). Following lower limb pathology, highlighted by \\nstudies of ankle fractures, the main disturbance of walking gait is asymmetry \\n(38, 39).

The \\nLEAP study made the first detailed economic evaluation of the associated \\nhealthcare treatment cost of sustaining an open lower limb fracture by com -\\nparing the lifetime cost of reconstruction vs amputation (42). The main drivers \\nof resource use after injury were identified as direct healthcare costs and pro -\\njected lifetime costs. Direct healthcare costs included the initial hospitalisa -\\ntion, readmissions, inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient clinic, physical and \\noccupational therapy attendances, and prosthetic devices and related services. \\nProjected lifetime costs included projected healthcare costs and projected \\nprosthetic costs (42).\\nMore recently the WOLLF trial conducted a prospective economic evalu -\\nation alongside a UK multicentre randomised controlled trial to estimate the \\ncost- effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) compared with \\nstandard dressing in patients following open lower limb fracture (15). A\\xa0cost- \\nutility analysis was undertaken and expressed in terms of incremental cost \\nattributable to the NPWT per QALY gained as recommended by NICE.

Domains of health additionally identified as important in the pa-\\ntient experience of recovery were sleep, flexibility, temperature (in relation to \\nits effect on symptoms), fear, appearance, employment and finance, recovery, \\ngoal setting, adaption, and impact on others. This work has resulted in the cre-\\nation of the Wales Lower Limb Recovery Scale (WaLLTR), which has under -\\ngone validation on patients with open lower limb fractures (49). The WaLLTR \\nscale consists of a Likert and non- Lik ert section. The Likert section has 10 items \\ncovering 8 domains:\\n 1. Self- efficacy\\n 2. Pain\\n 3. Body image\\n 4. Activity participation\\n 5. Fear\\n 6.  Social imp act\\n 7. Financial considerations\\n 8. Perception of recovery.\\nCore Outcomes for\\xa0Open Lower Limb Fracture \\nStudy (CO- OLLF)\\nIn March 2019 following COMET guidance, a COS was developed for pa -\\ntients recovering from open lower limb fractures to identify what outcomes to \\nmeasure.

Psychological distress in this context is common and can \\nbe lasting. Evidence suggests that approximately a third of severely injured \\nadults screen positive for a likely psychological disorder up to 2\\xa0years post-  \\ninjury (1, 2). This is a new diagnosis for many (1), indicating that the impact \\nof injury has a sustained effect on their lives. Evidence from patient experi -\\nence combined with existing psychological models may provide guidance for \\nappropriate clinical input. This chapter outlines what we know about patient \\nexperience of open fracture of the lower limb, considers practical psycho -\\nlogical support drawing on cognitive-  beh avioural principles, and explores \\ntwo key patient challenges:\\xa0changes to appearance and heightened psycho -\\nlogical distress.\\nPatient\\xa0experience\\nPatient- based evidence underpins clinical guideline development (3)\\xa0and pro-\\nvides opportunities for developing shared understanding and decision making \\n(4). Interviews with patients whilst in hospital (5)\\xa0as part of the UK Wound \\nManagement of Open Lower Limb Fractures (WOLLF) trial (6)\\xa0highlight the \\nsignificant impact of trauma on patients’ lives and emotional well-  being . The \\nfollowing provides a summary of their experience:\\n ◆ Participants were shocked by the strength of their emotions, which they had \\nnot experienced before, or they compared to feelings they had when a family \\nmember died. It felt like an emotional rollercoaster. At the same time, they \\nwere controlling their emotions to help their family and friends cope with \\nthe impact of their injury.\\n ◆ Participants talked extensively about their pain, the different types of pain, \\nand approaches to pain control. Many identified a time when they were in \\nextreme pain.\\n ◆ Participants were horrified by their wounds, skin, and muscle flaps. They \\nwere grateful to staff who supported them and helped them to understand \\nwhat was happening to their legs. However, they needed to feel ready to see \\ntheir wound for the first time and time to adjust to their wounds, often be-\\nfore showing them to family members.\\n ◆ Being physically constrained by their injuries was a real struggle for patients; \\nthey monitored their bodies and were grateful for a degree of control over \\ntheir ability to move about but were frustrated by inactivity.\\nThis is an open access publication.

They felt there was a point where they became ready to think \\nabout it and visually imagine it. However, they remained anxious about what \\nit would be like and sad about the things they would not be able to do.\\nIn summary, in the early phase of recovery patients with open fracture of the \\nlower limb require support to enable them to:\\xa0(i) express strong emotions, (ii) \\nmanage their pain, (iii) adjust to having wounds, (iv) live with limited mobility, \\nand (v)\\xa0reimagine their future life.\\nLater on in recovery, there is some evidence that patients have changed lives \\nand struggle to return to normal or adapt to being disabled. For example, the \\nimpact of not being able to bear weight was noted by patients with fractures \\naround the ankle in interviews (n\\n\\xa0=\\xa036) up to 10 weeks post- injur y, where they \\nexpressed frustration and felt depressed due to inactivity and being confined to \\na small geographical space (7). In addition, major trauma patients (n\\n\\xa0=\\xa015) at 3– \\n6\\xa0months, including those with lower limb injury, identified how they were de-\\ntermined to get better, frustrated by setbacks, wanted to do the right thing but \\nultimately felt they needed to redefine who they were in order to incorporate \\ntheir injury into their life (8). Interviews with participants with open lower limb \\nfractures (n\\n\\xa0=\\xa09) up to 2.8\\xa0years post- injur y suggested they were still struggling, \\nwith some not returning to normal (9). In this study, participants identified \\nongoing pain and stiffness, reduced mobility, fear of falling, concerns about \\ntheir appearance, and changed finances as affecting their lives. The vulnerability \\nexpressed by patients with open fractures of the lower limb suggests that a con-\\ntinued focus on emotional well- being , pain, wound management, mobility, and \\nhopes for the future are important to support patients’ recovery from traumatic \\ninjury.\\nPractical psychological\\xa0support\\nEmotional support offered to patients who experience closeness to death or loss \\nof limb is embedded in daily hospital activities (10) and is a central part of inter-\\nventions to reduce distress. Timely assessment of how patients are feeling, their \\nsocial support, and current coping strategies provides a basis for identifying \\nthe specific interventions required. An evidence- bas ed model for carrying out \\nsuch an assessment can be drawn from cognitive-  beh avioural therapy (CBT) \\n(11). As a treatment, CBT is one of a number of appropriate models that may \\nbe used and it can aid a trauma team’s understanding of a patient’s response \\nto their injury. The model highlights the interplay between how an individual \\nthinks, feels, and behaves in relation to their physical experience. It is under -\\npinned by recognition that a person’s experience of an event, in this case an \\nThis is an open access publication.

Patients with a high trans- femo ral amputation who do not tolerate standard \\nprosthetic sockets could be considered for osseointegration.\\nIntroduction\\nSustaining a severe open tibial fracture is a life-  cha nging injury regardless \\nof whether the eventual clinical outcome is amputation or limb reconstruc -\\ntion (1). Surgical treatment is only the first stage of the patient’s recovery. For \\nthe patient to achieve their maximum potential for physical, social, and psy -\\nchological function, greatest participation in society, and quality of living, \\nthey require a combination of training and therapy collectively referred to as \\nrehabilitation (2).\\nAfter initial surgical treatment there are a finite number of possible clin -\\nical outcomes ranging from the surgical objective of infection-  fre e bony \\nunion and healed wounds and a useful limb, to primary amputation in an \\nunreconstructable limb. Between these two outcomes is a spectrum of limbs re-\\nquiring ongoing treatment for infection and/ or pr oblems with healing of bones \\nand soft tissues. Those that suffer with persistent complications/ cons equences \\nof injury may end up with a delayed amputation. The goals for rehabilitation, \\nhowever, must remain the same, namely to maximise the return of limb func-\\ntionality and to help integrate the patient back into society by facilitating op-\\ntimal quality of life. Aside from the limb injury, patients may well have other \\ninjuries, e.g. traumatic brain injuries or pre-  exist ing medical co-  morb idities, \\nand therefore each patient’s rehabilitation needs will vary considerably.\\nThere is a lack of prospective interventional trial data on rehabilitation fol -\\nlowing open tibial fracture. However there are sufficient observational studies \\ntogether with trials from related fields, e.g. neuro- reh abilitation, to allow clin-\\nical standards and recommendations to be developed. The standards presented \\nin this chapter are consistent with those proposed by the National Institute for \\nHealth and Care Excellence (NICE) (3), the British Society of Rehabilitation \\nMedicine (BSRM) (2), the NHS Clinical Advisory Group Trauma (Trauma-  \\nCAG) (4), and those adopted by the National Clinical Audit of Specialist \\nRehabilitation following Major Injury (NCASARI) (5).\\nRehabilitation\\xa0services\\nThe Trauma- CAG ident ified rehabilitation services as a central component \\nof the formation of the Major Trauma Network (4). Rehabilitation in major \\ntrauma centres (MTCs) should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) \\nled by a consultant in rehabilitation medicine (2– 4).\\nThis is an open access publication.

The most commonly used diagnostic criteria is the US Centers for \\nDisease Control (CDC) surgical site infection tool (11), though the recently \\nproposed fracture- spe cific tool from Metsemakers et\\xa0al. (12) should be con-\\nsidered for future use.\\nAmputation\\xa0rate\\nThe rate of amputation following severe open tibial fracture, often regarded \\nas synonymous with ‘failed reconstruction’ , has also been cited as an outcome \\nmeasure (9). However, this is problematic as it assumes reconstruction is always \\nthe superior outcome, a position not supported by multiple studies that have \\nfound either similar or superior patient- repo rted outcomes following amputa-\\ntion (1, 13– 15). The us e of amputation rates as an outcome measure in isolation \\nshould be avoided and surgeons should continue to base complicated discus-\\nsions with patients regarding amputation and reconstruction on the likely best \\noutcome for the individual patient.\\nPatient- reported outcome\\xa0measures\\nIt is now accepted practice to measure the success of medical treatment at least \\nin part on the patient’s perception of the results of the intervention. Following \\nopen tibial fracture, the main choice is between using an anatomic-  spe cific \\nmeasure, i.e. looking at knee or ankle function, or a general health-  rel ated \\nquality- of- life (HRQ OL) measure (15). There is currently no specific outcome \\nmeasure for measuring recovery after tibia fracture.\\nThe main HRQOL measures used following orthopaedic trauma are the \\nShort Form- 36 (SF - 36) (15), t he Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) (16), and the \\nEQ- 5D (17). The ma in disadvantage of these tools is that concurrent injuries, \\ne.g. traumatic brain injury, will be reflected in the overall outcome measure, \\nand not just the effect of the lower limb injuries. An advantage over anatomic- \\nspecific patient- repo rted outcome measures (PROMs) is that general HRQOL \\nmeasures are applicable both to patients who retain their limbs and those who \\nundergo amputation.\\nSF- 36 has been the most widely used measure in studies of orthopaedic \\ntrauma, but its use normally incurs a cost, whereas SIP and EQ- 5D are a vailable \\non an open- use b asis for non- commer cial purposes.\\nEQ- 5D is the HRQOL outcome measure used by NHS England in the PROMs \\nprogramme (18), and is therefore recommended as the generic PROM for as -\\nsessing recovery following open tibial fracture. It is known that PROMs will \\nchange for years after injury (1), and so an arbitrary 12- mon th point is recom-\\nmended for recording EQ- 5D scor es.\\nThis is an open access publication.

This is examined in greater de-\\ntail in Chapter\\xa017. The events surrounding a life-  cha nging injury such as an \\nopen tibial fracture are frequently so outside normal experience as to result in \\npsychological injury.\\nThe Lower Extremity Assessment Project (LEAP) group detailed the pro -\\nlonged psychological impact of a lower limb-  thre atening injury persisting \\n7\\xa0years after injury (1, 19). The psychological effect for children with severe \\nlower limb injuries was documented by Levy et\\xa0al., who interviewed 40 paedi-\\natric patients with open tibial fractures. A\\xa0quarter of these patients continued \\nto suffer from flashbacks and nightmares involving the events of the accident.\\nA study by Bhat et\\xa0al\\n. (20) looked specifically at post- traum atic stress disorder \\n(PTSD) following open tibial fracture. This study used the Post-  Traum atic \\nStress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCL), a validated scoring system based on the \\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual IV definition of PTSD. The study showed \\nthat in a cohort of 60 patients who had sustained an open tibial fracture and \\nwho had undergone successful limb reconstruction, 30% of patients suffered \\nfrom PTSD. The other significant finding in this study was that patients younger \\nthan 50\\xa0years of age were at greater risk of PTSD. The authors speculated that \\nthe events producing the higher energies required to fracture younger bone \\nmight be more traumatic than those resulting in lower- energ y injuries in older \\npatients.\\nWhilst the majority of patients do not suffer long- term psychological conse-\\nquences following their injury, there should be provision within rehabilitation \\nMDTs for screening for PTSD using simple tools like the PCL. Ideally a clinical \\npsychologist should be a (usually part- time) member of the rehabilitation MDT \\n(21). If this is not possible, then the rehabilitation MDT’s occupational therapist \\nshould be trained to screen for PTSD and a referral pathway to local clinical \\npsychology services established.\\nChronic\\xa0pain\\nLimb- threatening injuries and the surgical treatments required to manage them \\nare potent pain stimuli. The management of acute pain is a core skill of a sur -\\ngeon treating these injuries, but it is recognised that for some patients painful \\nsymptoms can become more complex and persist beyond the point where the \\nsurgical goals of fracture union and wound closure have been achieved.\\nIdentifying chronic pain is challenging.

The point at which acute \\npain evolves into more complex chronic pain is poorly understood (23) and \\nthere is no defined time point at which pain symptoms can be regarded as be-\\ncoming ‘chronic’ .\\nThe persistence of painful symptoms after treatment for an open tibial frac-\\nture occurs after both amputation (24) and reconstruction (25), and is closely \\nassociated with, and regarded as a driver of, poor functional recovery (26). The \\nLEAP study reported approximately 20% patients with severe chronic pain \\n7\\xa0years after open tibia fracture (27). In a US study of opioid prescription it \\nwas found that 20% of patients who received surgery for a lower limb injury \\nwere still using controlled opiate analgesia 3\\xa0months after injury (28). In the \\nEuropean Chronic Pain Survey 18% of patients in the UK with chronic pain \\ncited a traumatic injury as the cause of their symptoms (29).\\nThe causes of pain symptoms are as heterogeneous as the limb injuries them-\\nselves. Pain following reconstruction is associated with fracture non-  union \\n(30), prominent metal work (31), post- traum atic arthritis (32), intra- med ullary \\nnail entry point (33), free tissue transfer, nerve damage (34), or often a combin-\\nation of these factors. Conversely, pain following amputation is usually associ-\\nated with nerve transection, neuroma (35), or prosthetic fitting issues, such as \\nbony prominence, heterotopic ossification, or soft tissue mobility (36).\\nSurgeons managing patients with limb- thre atening injuries should recognise \\nthat the effective control of acute pain is probably the most effective way to pre-\\nvent the development of chronic and complex pain (23).\\nSurgeons treating patients with ongoing pain symptoms after severe lower \\nlimb fractures should first identify and treat any potentially amenable anatomic \\ncause of pain symptoms (22). Second, they should recognise the development \\nof chronic and complex pain symptoms and identify the need for onward re-\\nferral to specialist pain services.\\nThe RCA Core Standards on Pain Medicine Service (22) recommend that \\nreferral of patients to specialist pain services following severe lower limb injury \\nshould be considered in the following circumstances:\\n 1. Patients with persistent or recurrent pain not adequately managed by sur -\\ngical team in conjunction with the patient’s GP .\\n 3. Patients whose pain is causing significant distress or functional impairment.\\n 4. Patients with analgesic misuse problems or who are taking recreational \\ndrugs/ alcohol for pain relief.\\n 5. Patients with pain-  rel ated psychological and psychosocial problems (e.g. \\npain- related fear, anxiety, reactive depression, functional impairment) that \\ncomplicate their pain symptoms or rehabilitation.\\nThis is an open access publication.

Consideration should \\nbe given to the use of peri-  neural c atheterisation (37) or epidural infiltration \\n(38) of analgesic and anaesthetic agents.\\nProsthesis and\\xa0orthotics\\nThe use of a prosthetic to replace function or an orthotic to augment it is com-\\nmonly required after severe lower limb trauma.\\nIn the case of amputation, the prosthetist’s role in the patient’s rehabilitation \\nis fundamental. When limb amputation is not being performed as an urgent \\nprocedure, the patient should be assessed by the rehabilitation consultant or \\nprosthetist prior to surgery (39). This allows the patient to be informed about \\nthe likely timing and sequential manner of prosthetic fitting, along with the ex-\\npected rehabilitation process.\\nWhilst the role of prosthetics following amputation is obvious, there is \\nincreasing evidence that orthotics may significantly improve function after \\nlimb reconstruction and retention. It is recognised that in patients with limb-  \\nthreatening injuries, particularly those involving the foot and ankle, outcomes \\nafter limb reconstruction can be inferior to amputation (14).\\nThe development of energy- sto ring and returning orthotics occurred as part \\nof the effort to improve rehabilitation in US service personnel with severely \\ninjured but reconstructed limbs (40), and has been shown to significantly im-\\nprove outcomes after reconstruction (41). Surgeons should consider refer -\\nring patients with poorly functioning reconstructed lower limbs for dynamic \\northotics.\\nOsseointegration\\nThe transfer of forces between the skeleton and the prosthesis occurs at the inter-\\nface between the prosthesis socket and the residual limb. This can frequently \\nbe a reason for pain and difficulty with prosthetic use as a result of poor soft  \\ntissues, heterotopic ossification, and bony prominence (42). Osseointegration \\nallows for the direct transfer of forces from the skeleton to the prosthesis, by -\\npassing the soft tissue envelope of the residual limb.\\nIn 1990 Brånemark et\\xa0 al. implanted the first osseointegrated mount for a \\nprosthetic coupling in a trans- femo ral amputee (43). Since then techniques and \\nimplants have improved and osseointegration has developed from an experi -\\nmental technique to a valid, albeit specialist, treatment modality (44).\\nThis is an open access publication.

Detailed evaluation of tissue can take time; in the physiologically un -\\nstable patient or in a mass casualty event the threshold may shift to a more rapid \\nand necessarily radical excision.\\nBullets and small metallic fragments can be left in limb wounds without \\ndetriment. Attempts to retrieve them may cause additional injury. Exceptions \\nto this are where they are intra-  art icular or impinge on movement and these \\nshould be removed. Environmental contamination, particularly non- meta llic, \\ntends to cause abscess formation if left. If minor, this does not always progress \\nto invasive infection. The contamination driven up tissue planes by blast tends \\nto impregnate adventitial layers and is not easily wiped off or irrigated out. This \\nnormally requires sharp excision of connective tissue.\\nThere are no peculiarities of blast or ballistic injury that alter the decision \\nmaking on bone viability but extensive periosteal stripping in high-  energ y- \\ntransfer wounds and deep impregnation of contamination should be antici -\\npated. In common with all wounds, copious irrigation after wound excision is \\nessential.\\nInitial skeletal\\xa0stabilisation\\nStabilising the fracture conveys stability to the soft tissue envelope and reduces \\ninfection. This is usually achieved using external fixation. It is preferable to \\nhave pins entering the bone through intact skin but this may not be possible \\nwith some defects.

It should be appreciated that, in the case of a systemic response to \\nblast, the whole body is effectively the zone of injury.

Under major incident circumstances there should be \\nopportunities for secondary transfers soon enough to allow compliance with \\nthese standards.\\nWhen the volume of cases overwhelms the major incident plan, a mass \\ncasualty situation exists (18). This is likely to occur when numbers are in the \\nhundreds and in this situation an adjustment to normal clinical pathways is \\nrequired. Major trauma centres may be filled up with multiply injured pa -\\ntients and isolated, albeit complex, limb injuries could be triaged for transfer to \\ntrauma units. Because of the scale of the event, secondary transfer of these pa-\\ntients to facilities with orthoplastic services may not be feasible for many days.\\nNot all mass casualty incidents will involve blast and ballistic mechanisms. \\nWorldwide, sudden onset natural disasters generate the greatest number of cas-\\nualties but these are unlikely in the UK. Terrorists have used blunt trauma mech-\\nanisms to inflict scores of injuries by driving vehicles into crowds. Historical \\npatterns suggest that about 25% of casualties will need immediate life-  sav ing \\ninterventions, 25% will need essential interventions that can wait, and 50% will \\nbe walking wounded or minor injuries.\\nThe recommendations in this publication are focused on achieving the best \\npossible outcomes for the individual patient. In a mass casualty scenario the \\nemphasis shifts to a more population- bas ed approach. A\\xa0crude example would \\nbe the difference between using an all- day li st to perform a complex reconstruc-\\ntion for a single patient or, instead, amputate that limb and do several more \\nsimple reconstructions on many patients. Similarly, the conversion of tem -\\nporary external fixation to a definitive modality may have to be delayed beyond \\nwhat is normally considered ideal.\\nEssential surgical procedures take precedent and the completeness of the first \\nsurgical intervention may be truncated.

The \\ntrue incidence is difficult to ascertain, although it is estimated that open frac -\\ntures comprise 3.2% of all fractures (1), with up to 21% of tibial fractures being \\nopen. Open fractures are more common in older people, with 296.6/  106/ year \\nin those aged under 65\\xa0years compared with 323.3/ 106/ year in those aged over \\n65\\xa0years, and 446.7/  106/ year in over 80-  yea r- olds (2, 3). F racture distribution \\ncurves demonstrate a bimodal form with similar incidence in the young male \\npopulation, 15– 19\\xa0ye ars of age, and females >90\\xa0years of age. Only 22.3% of \\nall open fractures are a result of high- energ y injuries (3)\\xa0and most often affect \\nyoung adults at their most productive time of life. Although the total number of \\npatients with open fractures is relatively small compared with the total number \\nof fractures treated each year, open fractures cause significant morbidity and \\nrepresent an enormous burden on healthcare resources. Healthcare providers, \\nmanagers, and clinicians have a duty to improve outcomes and use resources \\nefficiently.\\nIn 2016, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) pub-\\nlished guidance for trauma (4, 5). The Quality Standard from NICE includes a \\nstatement on the management of complex open limb trauma, recommending \\nan ‘orthoplastic approach’ to treatment (6).\\nNICE defined an orthoplastic centre as:\\nA hospital with a dedicated, combined service for orthopaedic and plastic surgery in \\nwhich consultants from both specialties work simultaneously to treat open fractures as \\npart of regular, scheduled, combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery operating lists. \\nConsultants are supported by combined review clinics and specialist nursing teams (4).\\nThe British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons/  \\nBritish Orthopaedic Association (BAPRAS/  BOA) group recommend that for \\nclarity this narrative description of an orthoplastic service by NICE is defined \\nin its component parts as follows:\\n ◆ A\\xa0combined service of orthopaedic and plastic surgery consultants.\\n ◆ Sufficient combined operating lists with consultants from both specialties to \\nmeet the standards for timely management of open fractures.\\n ◆ Scheduled, combined review clinics for severe open fractures.\\n ◆ Specialist nursing teams able to care for both fractures and fla ps.\\nIn addition, an effective orthoplastic service will also:\\n ◆ Submit data on each patient to TARN.\\n ◆ Hold regular clinical audit meetings with both orthopaedic and plastic sur-\\ngeons present.\\nThis is an open access publication.

This may cause concern as wholesale service changes would \\nneed to be implemented to achieve this new standard, at a cost that few hos -\\npitals could afford. Furthermore, there is no prescriptive template for such a \\nservice due to variations across the NHS in the UK, as well as a differing ap -\\nproach to trauma delivery between the home nations. However, the coordin -\\nated treatment plan defined by the combined approach results in expeditious \\ncare of the patient. Hospitals that have established orthoplastic services have \\ndemonstrated reductions in deep infection rates that offer cost savings that \\nwould be attractive to underfunded healthcare systems (7).\\nThere is evidence that outcomes of these patients are greatly improved \\nwith combined orthoplastic management at a designated centre, within de -\\nfined time frames (5)\\xa0compared with sequential treatment by separate spe -\\ncialties often within different hospitals. As well as reduced infection rates, \\nimproved outcomes include lower rates for non-  union an d amputation (7, \\n8), fewer unnecessary trips to theatre both for planning definitive treatment \\nand revision surgery (9–  11), red uction in time to soft tissue coverage (8, 10, \\n12, 13), shorter hospital stays and cost (10, 12, 13), and earlier recovery of \\nfunction  (14).\\nThe case for setting up an effective orthoplastic service for the effective man-\\nagement of open long bone fractures is, therefore, compelling. The aim of this \\nchapter is to describe how this can be achieved, the minimum required infra -\\nstructure for an operational orthoplastic unit, and to illustrate some of the sys-\\ntems and processes required in setting it up.\\nRequirements for\\xa0the\\xa0service\\nInitiating the\\xa0model for\\xa0change\\nThere is no single model for effective implementation of a new service. \\nEstablished practices are deep- roo ted and may appear ‘too difficult to’ or ‘not \\nrequiring’ change.

The ideal unit \\nhas to be aspired to, adequately resourced in terms of both clinical and man -\\nagerial time, and the steps both owned and understood to enable service goals \\nand outcomes to be achieved. The process should begin with engagement of \\nsenior management and consultants within the hospital trust or trusts. Clear \\nleadership enables top- down commitment to delivering evidence- bas ed prac-\\ntice. Having broken down the task into manageable stages, the approach to \\nchange can then be managed by ‘incremental gains’ .\\nThis is an open access publication.

The second scenario is that of cross-  site \\nworking within the same trust. Finally, the two specialties may reside in dif -\\nferent trusts. It goes without saying that the first situation is by far the most \\nconvenient for delivery of seamless care.\\nIn a hospital with co- loca ted services, the need for a new sub- spe cialty, driven \\nclinically, is most likely to be supported at executive level if little infrastruc -\\ntural change is required. There is a potential for conflict between the specialties \\nwhen funds are designated to a service not recognised as an income generator. \\nHowever, the costs associated with the service can be recouped when the sig-\\nnificant financial consequences of suboptimal management of open fractures \\nare taken into consideration (15). The costs and income can then be shared \\nequitably between specialties.\\nCross- site working within the same trust is more challenging. Although trust \\nobjectives will be standardised across the hospitals, the move for part of the de-\\npartment to form the orthoplastic service at the site of the major trauma centre \\nposes logistical challenges and additional investment will be required. Where \\nplastic surgery services are not on site at the major trauma centre, this must be \\nprioritised and capacity established for provision of a service that can provide \\nfree tissue transfer. This must be delivered by a group of consultants dedicated \\nto ensure service provision every day of the week.\\nThe most difficult circumstances for establishment of a new unit arise where \\nservices are in separate trusts. This is by far the most challenging set-  up, a s \\ntrusts face unique pressures and will have differing strategies to address these. \\nThere will be an even more significant burden for both cost and set-  up. E ven \\nwhen executive-  leve l support is achieved, the operational requirements, in \\nterms of coordinating the services and the resources, management, administra-\\ntion, and information technology, will need financial and personal investment. \\nA\\xa0phased implementation plan may be required with a clear route to achieving \\nkey milestones and reviewed at regular intervals.\\nWhatever the structural organisation, it is imperative that there are dedicated \\nleaders in both specialties for the orthoplastic unit to work. Furthermore, along-\\nside the clinical expertise, there must be the infrastructure support for operational \\ndelivery of the service. Without this, there is an unsustainable scenario that will \\nfail to deliver excellence in patient care. Irrespective of the precise model of the \\northoplastic service, all institutions must share the same goal of providing com-\\nbined care to the highest standards, as defined by national guidance (4, 5, 16, 17).\\nThis is an open access publication.

Local negotiations may take time and on occasion may appear fruit -\\nless, but the overriding agenda remains the provision of excellence in care for \\ntrauma as illustrated by the published standards (4, 16, 17). Alongside support \\nwithin the hospital system, support from the local commissioning groups is \\nalso important. The major trauma and burns clinical reference group within \\nNHS England produces the service specification. Centralised funding by way \\nof specialist commissioning enables delivery of trauma care to be supported na-\\ntionally. However, much complex orthoplastic limb reconstruction falls outside \\nthe national tariffs and support from local commissioners for a special local \\ntariff can considerably enhance management support for service delivery.\\nLocal\\xa0commissioning\\nIn order to recognise the ‘front end’ costs of the orthoplastic service for acute \\nopen fractures a meeting with local commissioners is essential. This will re -\\nquire detailed costing for the treatment of these patients in their current setting \\n(18) to address the fiscal imbalance.

Formal assessment of workforce and \\ntraining needs would greatly assist workforce planning.\\nWorking patterns in orthopaedics and plastic surgery need to provide con -\\nsultant flexibility to perform open fracture wound excision with less than \\n12\\xa0 hours’ notice. The majority of these procedures would occur in daytime \\nhours, so continuous daytime availability 7\\xa0days per week would be required, \\nwith an out-  of- hour s on- cal l facility.

This would imply that two or three plastic and two or three orthopaedic \\nsurgeons are job- pla nned for those lists.

The financial costs of immediate trauma \\ncare have been estimated at between £0.3 and £0.4 billion a year (19). Costs \\nfor subsequent hospital treatments, rehabilitation, social care home support, \\nand individual personal care are difficult to calculate, and the cost to an indi -\\nvidual in terms of function and loss of earnings are undetermined. Figures from \\nthe National Audit Office estimate a lost annual economic output of up to £3.7 \\nbillion.\\nA robust systems approach was adopted by the NICE Guidance Development \\nGroups regarding clinical evidence and cost effectiveness. Cost effectiveness \\ndenotes the expected costs of different options in relation to their expected \\nhealth benefit, rather than total implementation cost (20). The available data \\nwere reviewed and modelled by health economists at NICE.\\nThe cost efficacy for the combined orthoplastic approach for the treatment \\nof open fractures for patients managed at specialist centres was elegantly \\ndemonstrated (4). Sequential care by plastic surgeons following initial ortho -\\npaedic management was associated with higher infection rates, increased \\nnumbers of surgical procedures and inter-  hosp ital transfers for non-  co- \\nlocated specialties, and prolonged hospital stay dramatically increased the \\ncost per patient.\\nNICE considered the evidence relating to the presence of the plastic surgeon \\nwith the orthopaedic surgeon at the initial surgical wound excision and stabil-\\nisation. This was split into three areas:\\xa0the initial wound excision, the timing \\nof soft tissue cover, and potential multiple theatre sessions. Various outcome \\nmeasures were considered, including unplanned complexity of the soft tissue \\nreconstruction (impacting on surgical time, equipment, and staffing), free flap \\nfailure, as well as hospital stay and further unplanned surgery. The results dem-\\nonstrated a reduction in the costs associated with wound excision at all time \\npoints if a plastic surgeon was present. This is because, even with the additional \\nstaff and theatre time, the combined orthoplastic approach resulted in fewer \\ncomplications and hence was cost effective.\\nOther clinical studies have investigated comparisons between treatment be-\\ntween the two specialties and that combined in one unit. Specifically consid-\\nering healthcare utilisation, Page et\\xa0al. demonstrated that when patients with \\nopen tibial fractures were admitted directly to an orthoplastic centre, they \\nhad significantly fewer operations and GP attendances thereafter, compared \\nwith patients undergoing initial management elsewhere, with subsequent \\ntransfer (21).\\nWhilst the cost and clinical benefits are compelling, the initial investment \\nrequired to set up the service can be extremely challenging.\\nThis is an open access publication.
